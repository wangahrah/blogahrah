That girl is...well.  I suppose the short version is,  I might have to break up with my computer.

I'll be at her house for four days undergoing fatherly interrogation
before me and his daughter head out to creation with the
Knipples.  I'd post a picture of some Knipples but I don't think
I'm allowed to do that.

If you live in the Cincy area and want to see what I look like when I'm
wickedly fallen for a beautiful girl named Felicia, you can call my cell phone.

In other news, the job at Apple is COMPLETELY gotten now.  They
have my named signed in blood, and I'll start work when I get back.

Somebody set up us the bomb.
