I hope my kids find god

I hope they hear in the forest

feel on the beach

May their minds explore the mysteries of who and what we are,

and as they grow

may they follow their own star.

God is there waiting to find them, to be found by them but

we cannot trust ourselves to introduce our children to god.

we got it wrong. we don’t understand it much ourselves.

They do. They know, then it is lost. We lose our souls as we grow,

but we don’t have to. We are living life wrong. We need to live it better.

For us, and for them.

In the immortal words of the prophet,

> I believe the children are our futureTeach them well and let them lead the wayShow them all the beauty they possess insideGive them a sense of pride to make it easierLet the children’s laughter remind us how we used to be
