It seems there are a decent amount of "interesting" software companies with interesting ideas, business practices, etc.  They might work weird hours or have strange incentive programs...just conduct business a little differently than "as usual".  Less Dilbert-esque, more something-else-esque.

I like that. Alternative brains (as engineers often have) work most productively in alternative environments. In theory, we are "professionals", who make a salary because we have a job to do, regardless of hours worked.

So, let us do that.  Work from home, work from the office, work from the beach...is the job getting done?  Why does all the power remain in the hands of the employer, when it's the employee(s) that allow for the employer to exist?
