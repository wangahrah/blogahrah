## Do not be afraid.

---

We all feel this way. Have felt this way. Will feel this way again.

It’s out of our control. Everything. Our intentions were the best. We did nothing wrong. Our faith was sound and strong. Was it?

Is it my fault? Is it not? Does it matter?

---

This is how we feel. The pain, confusion, anxiety. Is it something real? Something minor? Imagined? Does it matter right now?

You can’t control it. You feel out of control. That’s the feeling. There’s some panic. Anxiety. It will fade. Let it fade. Love it. You will deal with what you need to deal with when you are ready.

---

You are not alone now. You spirit is communing deep beneath your consciousness with countless others who feel the same. Everyone who is in pain, who is suffering, who is anxious — you are not alone. You have each other.

We all have each other.

Why can we not see it?

Your burden is shared.
