desperately researching as to if one spaces or two after the period at the end of sentence is really correct, or if it doesn’t matter. it’s painful. especially when you don’t seek opinions, but try to seek if there is an objectively best answer for scientific reasons. and “it doesn’t matter” is a safe answer. but these emotions that rise in me over this topic is surprising.
