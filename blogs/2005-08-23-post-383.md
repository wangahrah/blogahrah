EDIT

This is not really how I feel; I just wrote it at the time. At least, I don't feel that vehement about it.

END EDIT

I'm back at the 'ville alright, and it certainly didn't take to long to
get extremely peeved by the rules.  A summer at home, where I'm
allowed to be mature and make discernment calls on my own...pretty
much, live a normal life of christian freedom.

Then, back to the 'ville and the Hill!  Which, by the way, is
dead.  No spirit left here; feel free to drop by whenever you want
ladies, there will be no chanting.  I'm taking some time to come
to grips with it, just something I have to do every year when I get
back.  Sacrifices must be made to stay sane.  Pretty much,
shutting my brain off, except my own theological research, bonding and
spiritual growth with the Palmer boys, and studying engineering.
Alas, and such, so forth.  And not having any more of this.
Beds lead to making babies.  As does holding hands.

Enjoy having your discernment done for you; soon, you, child, shall grow up and make decisions on your own.
