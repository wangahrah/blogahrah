Give me your money. Give from your lack of money — this will be multiplied and returned to you. Your faith to give the money you do not have will prove yourself worthy of reward. The more impoverished you are, the greater the return.

Give me your time. Give from your exhaustion. Sacrifice a portion of your schedule for me. Spend more time with me, and your time will be returned to you. Your sacrifice of time for me will yield incredible benefits to your schedule — when the time is right.

Give me your attention. Your phone notifications, your job, your family, your social media — your attention has become scarce. Many things demand it. Trust in me. Focus some attention on me, every day. Every single day.

*selah*

Do not trust your resources to the preacher. God does not seek your money, nor is God concerned with your finances. You will learn to use resources wisely.

Do not trust a full schedule to provide fulfillment. The most productive activities will, in time, weigh heavily upon your soul. Time spent as yourself, with yourself, is time spent wisely. Your loved ones are aspects of yourself.

Do not place your trust in attention to social media, your cell phone, your work, your television. Your attention is the product, bought and sold, for someone else’s gain. It must be reclaimed.

*selah*

Trust yourself, but only when you have proven yourself to be trustworthy. You must find yourself to know when you can be trusted, and when to seek external guidance. That external guidance will become part of you, and allow you to increase trust in yourself.

Trust yourself with your money, but only when you have learned what money means. To trust yourself with resources you do not understand is foolhardy.

Trust yourself with your time, but only when you have learned to spend it wisely. Time, unlike money, will pass by and cannot be reclaimed.

The world outside will always vie for your attention. Learn to hear your inner voice, and allow the universe to speak to you. It will teach you what matters.
