I saw this visitor to campus being harrassed by these two girls.
It was terrible and disgusting.  Then he went on a date with the
one on the right.  (The one on the left was too busy making racial
slurs to be asked out, even though she is stunningly attractive).  I talked to this fine fellow afterwards
and discovered that his name was Stuart, and he was a prospective
student.

Stuart told me that he was homeschooled, but that he was definetly the
most popular of his 11 siblings.  He figured since he was so
popular in high school he definetly would be in college, and was
already making plans for a lot of girls dating him.  He also met [Blake](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=the_great_colinski),
who taught him something about being cool and living in Brock.
His favorite color is yellow, and he likes daisies, if you want to buy
him a present.
