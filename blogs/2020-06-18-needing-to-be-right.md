Release your need to be correct. In a debate where two sides disagree, its often the case where truth is viewed in the binary. One side is wrong, the other, right.

Truth is rarely so canned and easy to digest. It’s not that truth does not exist — it’s that the truth often does depend on perspective and is more nuanced than most individuals are able to handle.

It takes a lot of energy to sustain a search for **the truth**. Most people don’t have the time to search for the truth of everything all of the time.

We don’t have to, if we adopt a stance where we don’t need to be right. We can listen to the wisdom of the time.

We are free to change.
