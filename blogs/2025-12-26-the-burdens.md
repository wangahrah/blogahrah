Atonement is shared. Nothing can be absolved. Nothing can truly be forgiven. The weight of the punishment can be shared to ease the pain of transgressions. How often do we suffer from the result of our own choices and sins?

It has been said that sins can be forgiven, but in truth, the actions of sin continue for a long time. The pain continues for a lifetime, and sometimes more. Perhaps one can bear the burden alone if they are God, but for humans, we are given to each other for the purpose of bearing each others’ burdens. We can lessen the pain of existence for each other.

Yet so often, we choose not to.
