So the verdict is in.  I spend my summer in sunny Maine, with days on the beach and nights dancing with hot babes.  Maybe.  I'm doing a research slash internship thingy at the U of Maine, and it should be stellar.  It's researching awesome things like thin film and pizoelectrcic sensors.  Maybe only engineers think that's fun.

But it was really quite pleasant to wake up one morning, not have an email, go to an exam, try to print out the notes from the exam 2 minutes before it, then get an email saying "Hey you're awesome so you can come research here, get paid a schmillion dollars, and have a sweet time." Especially after all my jobs back home were falling through. Jehovah Jireh as they say.  He provides both summer jobs, as well as root beer for long nights in the Palmer.  Which will be sweet action next year, featuring the likes of the [Colinater](http://www.xanga.com/the_great_colinski), the [Telloster](http://www.xanga.com/greypants5), and the [Hot Babester](http://www.xanga.com/Aubster99).  The last one is undecided as of now.

So take heart those lacking summer jobs.  Something will work out.  Maybe not money will work out.  But God will provide something that is needed by you, even if you don't realize.
