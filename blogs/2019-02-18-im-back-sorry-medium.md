why do i need to announce that i'm back to myself? no one reads this except me. and a few stalkers, i guess.

i'm excruciatingly tired of the rest of the world. i thought i'd write on medium to build an audience, and that worked out pretty well. it turns out i don't necessarily want an audience. instead of writing on medium and cross posting here (which i've never done), i'll write here, and cross post to medium things that i feel are worthwhile.

i hate that medium social-media-izes writing. i hate that i feel drawn to see if people clapped or started following me - especially when 'following' someone on that platform is of questionable use.

i'm not the *most* bothered by their monetization route - really, $5/month, some of which goes back to users (most of which goes to **power users**) isn't too bad. plenty of articles are worth that much to read.

it does seem to turn writing into a platform, and turning things into a platform in this age seems to come with some downfalls. something about power users, power posters, power writers, and a huge amount of lovely writing goes unnoticed.

anyway, i'm going to go back to being me. writing however i want. not worrying about if anyone likes it.

because fuck you guys
