## Make yourself heard. Take a stand.

Agiesm is rampant. Medium itself is engaged in a horrific form of this discrimination. I am disgusted, aghast, and horrified. Likely a few other terrible words. How a progressive-seeming organization could engage in something so — tribal, discriminatory, and wrong — is beyond me. It’s the worst kind of discrimination — discrimination against me.

Medium does not allow me to put two spaces after a period. In fact, I hit the space bar ***three times**** *after the previous period in anger, yet still only one space shows. You’ll never know how many spaces I truly want. What if want to mark myself as old, outdated, and obsolete? I’m saved the trouble of even having to think about if I want one space or two. Why can’t I demand respect and set myself apart for my wisdom in knowing that two spacing is the **true way**. Why can’t I *dare to be different*? Not only does it prevent me from displaying my two-space badge of honor — I say by denying me the motion of the cursor after a second space, it’s actively working ***to indoctrinate*** ***me*** into a new way of doing things, against my will. This is deceptive, manipulative, and wrong.

Who would have thought that something so hammered into my tiny child brain could have done a complete 180° from punishing me mercilessly for using one space? This is my own personal Vietnam. Can I bring a lawsuit against my teachers, Mario Teaches Typing, Mavis Beacon? Couldn’t it just have easily become three spaces? I hope 20 years from now it ***d*oes* ***become three spaces, just to spite all of the people who took two spaces away from me. Let them see how it feels.

(***yes****, i ****know ****it’s something to do with typewriters and monospace fonts, but why can’t you give me the dignity of this rant without ****judging**** me, you angry millennial.*)

If two space is out and one space is in, what else are we going to lose? Are we going to remove cheese from pizza and one of the buns from a hamburger? Is that the kind of world you want to live in? This clearly isn’t a slippery slope — it’s a vertical drop. It’s literary Armageddon, and the antichrist is your lack of spaces.

Whatever kids. I’m just glad that I can rest easy knowing that you’ll never be able to wrestle the Oxford comma from my one-spacing fingers. It’s still sexy, cool, and *very legal*. #youcanttaketheskyfromme
