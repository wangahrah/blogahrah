How you have fallen away from the Way. You are a tomb. Death fills you and is you. Some know where they are, and eagerly lure others in to face destruction. Some know nothing of their own stench, blissfully dancing in the naked orgy of destruction. The number of the Beast is Six. Six messages must be sent. The Beast has come, and the time of his reign is coming to an end.

### To the Church of Political Power

I despise what you have done to my people. I have hardened your heart that you may complete your work. You have twisted the Gospel as it has been twisted so many times before. Let those who have eyes see. The Way is not political nor to be used to build up the power of man. As you have used the power of God to build your own empire, you shall see your empire destroyed in the same manner. You will topple under the weight of those so led astray.

### To the Church of Martyrs

To be a martyr for your God, when called, is a noble thing. To victimize yourself into believing you are a martyr marks you as a fool, destined for destruction until you change your ways. You will gather many followers in the name of your martyrdom, but as you are filled with the marks of untruth, your followers will turn against you as they victimize themselves. Your own sins will come to destroy you.

### To the Church of Popularity

I am not a Way of convenience. I am not a vessel to gather your own believers. I speak to you, but your prophecies are perverse. To use my name to build your own following is shrewd, but you will find yourself on your deathbed hollow and alone.

### To the Church that Misunderstands

Your heart is in the right place, but you do not understand the message. Some of you have been led astray by false prophets, and others by your own ego. You will stand before my gates and knock, but must spend time waiting outside in the cold, contemplating your own foolishness. All is not lost. Keep seeking, and you will find.

### To the Church of Idiots

You are the loudest. You are the most charismatic. You are chaos. You must learn to be still and quiet, or risk your own destruction. What can one say to a fool? Let them find their own way, and leave breadcrumbs for them to follow.

### To the Church which Knows

You will never be known. You will never be heard. Keep your faith. Bring those with you that you can. Fear neither death nor destruction.
