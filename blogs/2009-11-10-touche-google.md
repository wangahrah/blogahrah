I found out that more people than I realized don't actually "read" my blog, but have it hand fed to them by Google Reader.  I don't really know anything about this Reader, but thanks for taking my hardwritten blags and turning them into a COMMODITY item that people don't even have to work for.

You all should be totally ashamed.
