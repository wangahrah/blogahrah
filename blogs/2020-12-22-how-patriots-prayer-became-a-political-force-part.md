*Note: This article has been long delayed. There have been many developments, including increased violent rhetoric from alt-right groups, who have targeted journalists and freelancers, occasionally with explicit death threat and more often violent rhetoric. I chose to stop writing for awhile for the safety of my family. I did not expect this going in, nor do I view myself as a threat to anyone — the alt-right movement has become increasingly irrational in who they label as a threat.*

Despite their perceived success of the rally, Battle Ground’s council would not pass the second amendment sanctuary proposal. The mayor, Mike, was called out by Joey Gibson as a socialist (again, without evidence) — just because he had a picture taken with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mayor Mike had voted *against* the I-1639 initiative, just like Patriot Prayer wanted, but for some reason was still the embodiment of what’s wrong in politics to Joey Gibson. Really, Mayor Mike was well in line with his constituents — but movements need scapegoats, and Mike was perfect. He was not afraid to, dare I say it — flap his mouth. He fought back online and made his voice heard, loudly, about the outside influences trying to take over town — this was perfect for stirring up the controversy that Patriot’s Prayer and their followers feed off of and use to grow. Now, Patriot’s Prayer had spawned a political group in the North County Sons and Daughters of Liberty, and one of the leaders, Shauna, announced her candidacy for city council.

Around council election time is when Joey Gibson showed up in my tiny town of Yacolt, WA. As with most small towns, not much of note to the outside world often happened here — and the town itself, outside of social media, didn’t pay much attention.

Assisted by local members of the NCSDL, signatures were gathered to bring before the Yacolt Council to make a proclamation against I-1639. They succeeded, and Yacolt became the first Second Amendment Sanctuary City. What does this mean? Very little on the surface. Yacolt itself doesn’t even have a police force — laws are enforced by the County Sheriff, who will follow I-1639. Practicality aside, it was truly a victory — Patriot’s Prayer had their first Second Amendment Sanctuary City.

This is where I took a long journey through Yacolt town politics. I could write a book about it. There was incredible drama — accusations of abuse of power, violation of laws resulting in deleted emails (when will people learn, and how many stories of deleted emails will we continue to hear?), votes to remove a council member that were ignored, incredible incompetence, total dysfunction, and in the end, a NCSDL member voted into political office. I will focus only on the parts most relevant to this story. Truth be told, small town politics deserve a reality show on the level of **House of Card**s.

It started (at least, for me — the drama had being going on for some time) when the Yacolt Council held a special vote of members to install someone to fill a vacant seat. There were three applicants — a bit strange, as often the unpaid city council seats stood vacant and were almost always filled by those running unopposed. One applicant was the husband of a sitting council member. Another was Michelle Dawson, a member of Patriot Prayer and NCSDL. Michelle lost. The spouse of the sitting council member won.

The town discussion forum (again, of course, on Facebook), erupted — quite easy to do when a few loud folks are able to dominate, and when the husband of Michelle, Jeremy, is one of the loudest. Those associated with NCSDL (and, most interestingly to me, the *mothers* of many people involved) loudly cried out against corruption in government and how it was unethical for a wife to vote for husband to be on the town council. The mayor informed folks, very cleary — the town had cleared all of the happenings with the county and their legal team — there was no real issue. However, this crew wanted their people on the city council, and controversy is how you stir interest. Fights raged and tempers flared. All of this over a council seat that would be vacated in several short months after the formal election — which Michelle was running for, and the newly elected short term member was not running for.

Joey Gibson and Patriot’s Prayer spoke loudly about this matter, and showed up at a council meeting. The rules at that meeting were enforced — no one from outside of town limits could talk. Joey didn’t have his in-person platform. They attempted to have a flag-waving rally before the meeting, but people live in and move to Yacolt to get away from these things, not to participate. Almost no one showed up besides a me and reporters from two local papers. However, since Joey didn’t speak, it turned into a non-story.

Name recognition is one of the most powerful aspects of running for political office. Michelle Dawson now had that, along with the support of Patriot’s Prayer, the NCSDL, and all the right-leaning folks that reside in a small, rural town. The power of Patriot’s Prayer wasn’t really needed — this town was ready to vote for a second amendment supporter, and as she was the only name on the ballot for her seat, it was almost certain she would win. The narrative is distracting — I don’t think *anyone* running for a council seat was against the second amendment, or particularly left leaning.

It was fascinating to see the far-right paint the mainstream-right of our tiny town as liberals and socialists. When social media comes into play, things get bloody — and bloody inaccurate. Several folks were trying to get to the bottom of *me* — they were certain someone was paying me to film and write. I can assure all of you, much to my wife’s chagrin — no one was paying me.

They needed to get to the bottom of **me** because I got involved personally in the Yacolt political process. I went to council meetings and livestreamed them, as well as budget workshops. I met with and wrote a short piece on Michelle’s write-in rival for the council seat to increase him name recognition, as I believed he was an excellent candidate — but knowing it was a long shot for a write-in candidate to win. I also met with Michelle (and her husband) to do a write up on her when folks complained about my writing something only about her opponent. I now know Michelle personally, and, quite frankly, like her as a person (*note: in the well-over-a-year since I first wrote this, that’s dramatically changed — ever since she labelled me an enemy*). I disagree with her on politics and the groups she is associated with — she is a staunch supporter of Patriot’s Prayer, the Proud Boys, and the NCSDL. When asked at a debate if she thinks it’s ok to support and be supported be extremist groups, her response was “Yes.”.

After a brutal political battle, mostly fought on Facebook, Shauna Walters was elected to the Battle Ground City Council and Michelle Dawson was elected to the Yacolt Town Council. This was their biggest win so far. At this time, Patriot’s Prayer was just Joey Gibson. Other members had quit, been told to leave, or charged with felonies — not that Joey hasn’t been charged with felonies as well. The group that had started with a single man flag waving in Portland, a failed Senate run, that grew to connect with violent groups, had felony charges thrown at them, and went town to town searching for a place to grow real political roots, had found the path to political power.

What I hadn’t realized yet is what a strange group of unlikely allies was coalescing into the Patriot movement, and my experiences with Patriot Prayer were just the tip of the iceberg.
