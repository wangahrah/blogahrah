For as long as greed has existed, we have sought an easy way to turn lead into gold. Wait, straw. Turn straw into gold. Hold on, I’m hearing toilets…now we want to turn porcelain into gold. Golden toilets — mission accomplished.

This seems to be the same alchemy that self improvement now brings to us. Perhaps it may be the commoditization of the industry? We no longer need to trust or find the thing of greatest value, which often ends up being labelled as **God**. Be like God — this is the ultimate path to self improvement. In this era, with fewer visible gods, we can turn to trusting man— yet this has an unfortunately side effect of turning man into cheap versions of a knockoff god. Not enough people are striving for the glory of Cthulhu.

Our interesting and often under-utilized ability to self-change (in this case, in the context of *improvement*)* *seems to be overrun with a model matching that concept of alchemy — a model of searching to turn the bad parts of ourselves into good parts as easily as possible, even if that way is *too* easy. If it’s too good to be true, but costs me nothing, let’s give it a go. Put the lead in the hopper, out pops gold. Put your lazy self through a process, an app, a lifestyle coach or guru’s system, and out pops an efficient and fully *woke *human who wakes up at 5AM, eats a healthy breakfast, and runs a marathon. It’s neuroscience. It’s just how our brains work. We understand it now…it’s gold! At least, it looks like gold. For awhile. By the time you’ve learned that you’ve been bamboozled, the salesman who sold you a wonderful story has your money and is long gone. It was only $10 or so though, so who cares.

It’s not that there will never be a technological way to turn lead into gold. It’s probably going to end up as problem of being able to reasonably source enough power — strikingly similar to self-improvement, I suppose. As long as it’s available with free shipping, why not, make it a commodity. It’s not that neuroscience isn’t real, or that psychology is totally bonkers — systems are complex, and your self is quite a beautifully complex system. Yet, in all the complexity, we are eager to find a simple answer — but then we see the gold market collapse, because this system was more complex than we thought, and pumping gold into it turns out to have some side effects.

The easy-button mechanism is now often disguised as **10 Steps to Awesome**, or the **3 Essential Steps to Unlocking your Inner Awesome**, and the even better **This One Trick is the Most Awesome**. The fewer the steps, the more powerful. The power of simplicity. Please stand by for my bestselling novel — **How to Be More Awesome by doing Nothing at All.**

It is pleasant to find a list of the ways to improve your productivity, and I apologize — I do not mean to say there is no knowledge or wisdom contained in such lists. I do know that few, if any, list of ways to change anything about myself has truly done what it claimed. Perhaps that is because many of these lists are only a marketing strategy intended to push me to buy the full set of material — you can’t give your valuable information away for free, can you? I hope to not seem too down on any of these business models — rather, I hope for people to be more aware of what it is they are doing, and what it is they want to be doing.

There is no easy button. There are ways to change yourself, and in a sense self-improve, but it is difficult for another person to tell you how to do it, and depends heavily on what truly is an improvement for your life. If you choose to convert to their methods, by all means —but understand what you really want to change. You can move from being trapped in your view of yourself as one needing improvement to being trapped in someone else’s system, which will also inevitably change other parts of you. If you improve yourself in one way, it will effect your life in other ways. If you become a slave to a system that is far superior to your vision of yourself, perhaps view it as a stepping stone rather than a permanent change of mindset. I’d wager the system you subscribe to has its own set of values, which may not perfectly line up with yours — but sometimes you may find yourself in a life place where converting to someone else’s belief system actually *is* the best choice for your life at that time.

True change (and please reject what I say next, as you likely should most claims of *truth *until you have thought long on them), practically speaking, ends up being highly personal and holistic. Mentorship and one and one growth is valuable. Is your teacher telling you how things are, or guiding you to understand how things are? Are they presenting you with more questions, or more answers? If outside values are being imposed on you, they are converting you, which does not necessarily mean you are improving. (However, they **will** honestly believe that they are helping you to improve, so sincerity should be expected — both from the religion and the life coach).

It is wise to seek ways to change yourself. Do it when you understand yourself enough to know what things you want to change. To learn how to do that, search for my book, **How to Meditate while looking Pretentious at the Same Time.**

A final thought— the current trend of optimization and efficiency of our human selves should be thought through. Assuming we can use the **Top Ten Productivity Hacks** to become the übermensch who has transcended the silly need for sleep, we must stop to consider what this means. Just because we can, does that mean we should? No other living creature seems to be so concerned with productivity — and it is a relatively recent phenomenon that humans have become so obsessed with it.

What is your purpose here? Does that productivity result in something truly good for yourself, when you have understood your own true desires and values? Does it result in good for the universe as a whole? How would you go about understanding what **good** means for the universe? Is it going to turn out that the Global Consciousness was real all along, and we connect to it most deeply during sleep, and so our quest for the cure for sleep to maximize productivity accidentally cut us of from what truly sustains us? Probably.
