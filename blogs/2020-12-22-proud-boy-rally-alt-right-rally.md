“Do you want to grab lunch?” I asked him. “Can I help you out with some food?”

He looked up. His eyes were bright and clear. His voice was upbeat with a hint of humor.

“No, but thanks. Honestly, I just ate. I hate to play into this stereotype, but I really could use some tobacco if you have any”.

I’d noticed a middle aged man standing on the outskirts of the political rally, not really paying much attention to the Proud Boys and company or their polar opposite, Antifa and and the Left. **HOMELESS DISABLED VETERAN — PLEASE HELP!** read his sign.

“Has anyone talked to you today or offered you help?” There were lots of people present, on both sides, who vocally support veterans and homeless.

“Nope. They never pay attention to us”. He didn’t seem particularly sad about this — just accepting. I wanted to know what his perspective was on the rally and the political climate.

“Do you support or care about these groups? What’s your take on what’s going on today?”

“Eh, I think they’re all deluded. They’re not really that different from each other. They need to realize that they’re both being used as tools by people with money to push their agendas, and they have more in common with each other than they do with the people at the top with money and power”.

I was at one of the dueling political rallies in Portland, OR, on August 17th, 2019. This was a gathering of diverse right-wing protesters — organized by the Proud Boys, with a presence by the 3%’s, Patriots Prayer, and plenty of other groups. Present were paramilitary organizations and others classified as hate groups. I’d overheard two girls talking — they were from the east coast and had flown in for this rally. They weren’t associated with any specific group as far as I could tell, but were right leaning conservatives tired of being lumped in with hate. **We Don’t Hate** read their sign. A lot of folks attending seemed to not be affiliated with any group, but supported religious freedom, the Second Amendment and *traditional American values*, as they defined them.

The group was very racially diverse. Members of specific organizations proudly wore their colors and symbols. Many folks were dressed in riot-style gear, ready to rumble with Antifa, as they had many times before in Portland. Many more had no gear at all except the most important at a rally like this — their cell phone.

The police presence was strong and extremely visible. They’d barricaded the left wing protesters under the bridge while the right wing protesters marched to their gathering place. The right wing all took a knee for a prayer and singing the National Anthem. They talked about religious freedom and the right of American’s to bear arms. Government overreach was a common theme.

In the middle of the rally, the Right was playing some techno-electronica-remix station, getting pumped up. People were jumping, singing, and dancing. Some feel-good song that was a little more *emotional* came on — I think it was Total Eclipse of the Heart. They quickly jumped to the next song. The energy in the group was **strong** — they felt ready, and united. No time for fluff. They were standing for what they believed in — gun rights, religious freedom, and standing against socialism and government overreach. Classic American themes. There were not overt words of hatred.

Several of the Left found their way through the police line and stood on the outskirts of the Right. Some of the more battle-ready Right gathered, waiting. Any time it seemed things were getting to heated, the leaders of the Right pulled back their warriors, who immediately complied. Physical peace was maintained. The Left was telling the Right how full of hate they were, instructing them to get out of their city. The Right, overall, responded with phrases like “We love you!” and “We’ll pray for you!”.

I was taken aback by the number of selfie sticks and people livestreaming. At times, it felt more like a giant, right wing social media gathering than a protest. The police maintained their line, a silent reminder to everyone to be civil.

The other side of the protest was a diverse group of people and organizations, gathered under the Antifa label. Many were dressed in wild outfits with signs denouncing hate, Trump and white supremacy. Some were dressed in all black outfits with masks, and have attacked and harassed right wing protesters. Earlier that morning, President Trump tweeted out a suggestion that there should be some consideration given to labeling them domestic terrorists.

There was what felt like chaos behind their barricade. Music. Drums. Chanting. Dancing and writhing. Probably some great drugs. The common theme was that they believe the Right supported racism, hate and were facists, while this group stood for **inclusion** and **love. **Mostly, they wanted these people out of their city, and they weren’t afraid to say it in a loud, fuck-you-facist sort of way.

I’d be following the patterns of the, for lack of a better term, relationship between the Right and the alt-Right casually over a year. I live in Trump Country as one of the few remaining centrists (or so it seems). I live very peaceful with the Right and the Left — it’s true that what connects us is more powerful than that which separates us. If you don’t mention Trump, Hilary, or Obama, you just connect with other families, mothers, and fathers, who want the best for their family and their community.

A lot of those folks attend these rallies. This is not a defense of the “There are good people on both sides!” debate — which is, in point of fact, a terrible, distracting talking point that has little to do with what is going on. A greater issue than political belief is how we treat each other. Putting the other side into a box is going to be troublesome. Not all of the Right is racist — in fat, most are not racist any more than those on the left. Not every Left is pursing radically socialism and trying to undermine structure of our American institutions. To watch the mainstream media (on both sides), you’d think there are simply ***TWO*** types of Americans, and nothing in between — and those two opposites loath each other. I see the loathing for the caricatures increasing, but I don’t see people fitting into those molds. By the end of this, we’ll have a giant field of straw men lying dead.

In the end, I saw two groups of people — the Left and the Right. Both groups were composed of a wide variety of different (and sometimes competing) ideologies, each of which had chosen to band together for the greater good — at least, their side’s view of the greater good. One side believes they are fighting against facism, the other against radical authoritarian communism. One side believes they are fighting against racism, the other for the security of the country they love.

Mixed in to his is a host of bad actors — actual facists. Actual communists. Actual racists. Actual folks who are trying to bring down the government. Making the accusations of both sides, to an extent, true.

Is there any true enemy to be found?
