I wonder if anyone reads these during the summer....

I join in those young youths who are working on gettin summer jobs!!
After my short story, I submit a thought for your thinking pleasure...

Most just want to work at the Apple store in the Palisades mall.
Guess only NJ/NY people know where that is...and Apple computers, not
fruit.  Sheesh, selling fruit all summer, how awesome would that
be.  But I keep calling and not getting anywhere. We'll see. I'm
hoping it works out.

But if it does not...take off cross country?  Who wants to
come?  There can be a few of us.   Cross-genderal is
allowed.  Mostly, it's blowing off the summer (in a blowing off
the capitalist pigs! sense) and going to wherever, getting odd jobs
here and there, it's all up to whatever I suppose. I really want to go
meet people in cities.  Work in churchs.  A pretty sweet way
to serve God all over the country and have a blast...really we could do
anything, and maybe not even plan to do anything.  Would anyone be
up for that?  I'd leave in a few weeks and sell a bunch of stuff
to get some money for gas...otherwise, the road is our friend.
Anyone up for it?  Or just tell me why it's dumb like most
people=)?  We could play sweet music like the Allman Brothers and
the Beatles and U2 and Avril Lavigne.
