I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about feet.

I'm a big fan of feet.  I always have been.  People would
look through the pictures on my computer and say, "Ew, why are there so
many pictures of feet?"  To which I replied, "I don't feel the
need to explain my art to you."

I don't really have any art, I just like feet.  Does that make me weird?

Look at this picture.

How does it make you feel?
