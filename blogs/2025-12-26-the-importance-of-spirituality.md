Spirituality is so important that we don’t really need to worry about it at all.

We inherently seek spirituality, though it looks different religion to religion, person to person, creature to creature.

We simply do it. Therefore, there is no need to seek it out. Perhaps there is some benefit of looking at the civilizations we have created through the lens of how they seem to have a tendency to stifle our ability to connect to our spirituality.

All our religions, practices, and so on, are discrete manifestations of our spirituality — representative of a part, but not a whole, and in different practices those representations often serve the same purpose or point the the same symbolic archetype, but have differing veneers.

This is why it is fine to be a Christian, or a Buddhist, or an Atheist or Muslim or Wiccan. We cannot help but connect with our spirituality.

Yet I do strongly urge the resistance to organized religion of all sorts, beyond what is helpful to forge a community that can revel in the joy of shared spiritual experience, shared through the same lens, with the same understanding. This needs not to take away from any other group’s experiences — a part of our spirituality is individual, and another, perhaps equally valuable part, is communal. Our souls long to sing authentically, and they long to sing together.

These formalized, mainstream religions seem to inevitably spring from a prophet or mystic or shaman of sorts — one who I imagine to genuinely pursue a path of spiritual exploration. As we find our spirituality naturally and instinctively, I find we need no mandate to “explore” — but neither did we have mandate to explore science, and I sit here typing on a computer connected to the internet. It’s in our nature to explore, and it is in the nature of some to explore things deeply and share the harvest with the world. To dive deep into the question of “What is this whole spirituality thing” is as equally as valuable as to simply intuitively connect to our spirituality and never wonder why, so let the prophets have their time.

When these folks who have explored the nature of God, the Universe, and Everything come back, of course they appears as Wise Men. They know something about a thing. They learned about it themselves, and shared with you. Their wisdom is apparent, and those who have ears to hear listen.

Shortly after that, the aspects of spirituality and wisdom that they explored for themselves and shared with their community become canon, viewed as The Way, and thus cease to very much be the way at all as the religion they accidentally spawned becomes a monstrosity, antithetical to the tenets they purport to be based on. Nevertheless, their symbols retain power, and the institution of that religion becomes something awful and oppressive indeed. Perhaps someday we will be able to pursue the wisdom of the wise men more than the wisdom of the religion that sprung forth from their mysticism, quite unknown to them.

So the importance of spirituality is something between everything nothing. It matters little if you dive deep or not. If you do choose a path of spiritual exploration, make sure to only listens to the spirituality you connect with when you are in the woods or on the water. The knowledge and wisdom you gain will be yours — you will share it with other mystics and shamans, and recognize the nature of Truth, and the Truth shall set you free.
