How are we even here? Trump has turned all of our media into a constant reality show. There’s so much bullshit (and seriously, on both sides). Now, I do tend to think the left side of media is more intelligent and funnier, and Chris Cuomo is a real cutie, but seriously. Everything doesn’t need to get blown up like it is. Does anyone else feel that weird sexual energy between Chris and Kellyanne, by the way?

I won’t really address Fox, because I can barely even see how it’s news. Not even that it’s fake, it’s just barely news.

I have the feeling it doesn’t matter, and they’re all in cahoots. A lot of media groups are indeed making bank off of this presidency. Especially tabloids, apparently. Surprise.

I view it as somewhat karmic. America has been worshiping money for so long that of *course* this is what would happen. The president with the golden toilet.

Look at this cast of characters, some of which have already been voted off of the island. Spicey, we miss you. Scaramucci, you gave me the opportunity to say “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock” to someone who would *never* say that but defends Trump. Seriously, I’m not proud of doing that to someone, but sometimes I get so confused about how people can not be confused that I can’t help myself. Sarah, you go girl. Never break! Never change! Keep those smokey eyes. Also, Mnuchin?

The other night me and my wife Meghan were watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 on ***flix, and they made some kind of joke that was totally relevant to Trump. I found my mind wander back to questioning time and reality, and wondering how, in all of the timelines, did I end up in the one where Trump was really elected president? I think a few minutes had gone by with me staring off into space, totally ignoring the movie, wondering.

“Michael, what are you thinking about?” Meghan asks.

Dammit. She’s always asking me what I’m thinking about, and I’m always thinking. Apparently I look like a damn fool when I think too, making all sorts of dumb facial expressions. That’s how she knows. It’s my very obvious tell.

“Are you wondering how we got here again?”

Dammit. She knew. She always know.

I had a friend from college come over. She gave him a demonstration of how I would slowly and heavily walk down the stairs, sigh, walk wearily into the kitchen, and say “Babe, did you hear about this?”, and then go into whatever rant about whatever tabloid-style drama was occurring and how stupid it was for that thing to even be occurring.

She’s a pretty good actress, and she’s forced to spend a lot of time with me what being stuck with me because we had kids together (and also are in love), so she really nailed the performance.
