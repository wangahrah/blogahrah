Technology simply **is**. It does not come infused with inherent good or evil. It’s a reflection of natural laws, assembled and used for a purposes. We can use a hand-held tool to build a house or to slaughter our neighbor. We can split an atom to generate massive amounts of useful power, or to drop a powerful bomb on our enemy. Both these technological advances can and will be used for applications that will be called both good and evil, and the label will flip depending on perspective. My bombs are good, and used to defend my people. Your bombs are bad, and used to kill my people.

Questioning if a technology is good or evil is the wrong question. It is neither, and it is both. It is wholly good and wholly evil. I wholeheartedly explore my own understandings of good applications, and try to apply this understanding as best I can for the betterment of many. Despite my efforts, there will always be some who will define my actions, research, or what technologies I develop as evil. I must also accept there may be a time where I look back with regret on what I have accomplished, as have many wiser than me.

Though the good and evil labels may tricky, and hard to absolutely define as true, I hope we can agree that it is true that technology *exists*. As it exists, it will continue evolving as an organism of its own, being developed by many different creatures, and being incredibly **rapidly** developed by humans — more so than ever before in our \*known \*history.

Some human communities bind themselves to a previous generation of technology — at times because they view further progress as bad. This seems arbitrary — technology from one age or another tends to be just differently-advanced, not differently-moral.

I’m not advocating against groups that sequester themselves and limit themselves to a subset of technologies — in fact, I see great benefit to selecting technologies for their helpfulness to the community, and choosing to reject that which hurts or is unhelpful. However, it also must be acknowledged that many of these groups would be unable survive if they were not nestled into a larger group embracing progress, leading to development of technologies of war which allowed for the defense of their culture.

To lock oneself to a previous generation of technology is not sustainable, unless a partnership with a more advanced civilization can be secured. How long will the more advanced civilization allow the lesser advanced civilization to flourish within them?

Instead of looking back and choosing to limit our technology, we can choose to forge rapidly ahead. We can hope that being the first to develop new technology will allow us to control it and use it for good. If we are the first to develop technology to allow us to teleport, or synthesize, or to have unlimited energy, we will be able to have some level of control of what’s done and how technology is used.

This is also a lie when viewed from a higher perspective. The faster technology is developed, the more accessible it will become to the masses and to other civilizations, who will adapt it for purposes you view as evil. It will also be adapted for many untold purposes you will call good, wonderful, and beautiful. Your developments are not good nor evil — they simple *are*.

This does not remove responsibility from anyone developing the technology. I hope these thought serve to increase the responsibility accepted by technologists.

I believe the best we can do is to thoughtfully consider what technologies we are working on developing, and mindfully apply what wisdom we can to the applications.

The difficulty in this, in our current age, seems to come from rejecting technologies that would be lucrative or help consolidate power, but be overall quite harmful. To be able to reject building a technology that can be lucrative, yet is harmful to others, is not of interest to most people. They are busy defending their own tribe, and if others suffer, so be it.

There are incredibly wonderful problems to be solved, and dancing with technological advancement allows us to live life in ways that seem impossible. Technological utopia is a dream, but a lovely dream — and should we not be targeting the loftiest goals possible? How else would we even come close to achieving them? Where are the technologists pursuing these dreams, and how do we bring this to forefront of innovation?

It seems most of those who fund and develop technology are concerned with making money and consolidating their own power. If technology is focused on these goals, I weep for the future of my children.
