*the entire universe lives within the eye of this baby*

During a time of meditation today (cue pretension), I was struck by a thought new to me. That is, I had no new knowledge, but had a different perspective on existing knowledge. Perhaps that’s where wisdom comes in to play, but intelligence vs wisdom is a discussion for another day, and we’ll need more Dungeons and Dragons fanatics to really have a proper discussion about which stat is the best.

Our body is its own world, and we are its god. I see the god of many religions as being abusive of their worlds— demanding total submission from all creatures, committing (or ordering his people to commit) genocide, not to mention killing babies, animals, and wreaking havoc on the world however they desire. They also really do some great stuff too. They are God, after all. Find yourself a God that does not abuse.

If I do not take care of my body, I am no different than an abusive god. Interestingly, even if I take care of my body, I am responsible for the deaths of many organisms that are trying to remove life from my body — virus, bacteria, parasites. My life and the life of an organism representing a fatal disease are fundamentally at odds. If those beings were to have some form of consciousness, I must imagine that I, as god of my body, would still wage war against them, even though hurting them is hurting another conscious being.

We are only just beginning to understand that we are more than a simple human creature. We are composed of many trillions of human cells. Each of these cells are their own complex, living organism. They die and are replaced. They reproduce, through a variety of mechanisms. Their health is dependent on complex array of variables, some of which we can relatively easily control (diet), some we have limited control over (environment), and some we have no control over (genetics — at least for now!).

Taking care of our bodies means taking care of the living, genetically human cells within it.

We are also composed of some number of non-human living organisms. Humans are composed of at least the same number, if not more, of non-human living creatures within us and on us than genetically human cells.

Think about gut bacteria. Not only should I be concerned with what my human cells need, I also need to respect that it’s the gut bacteria that *allow* me to survive and properly digest many foods. There are bacteria that are healthy and thriving, living within me, and I should support these colonies. There are bacteria that are unhealthy and would threaten the existence of **me**, and I should do what I can to keep them from multiplying. Also, plenty of cardio.

Eating healthfully is not just feeding my body — it is feeding the universe that I think of as **myself**. It is truly a complex, interconnected system of many tens of trillions of organisms. My *good* and *bad* gut bacteria are in a constant battle with each other for survival, and the outcome of that battle really matters to me, the god of this body-verse. There are many species living in my stomach, unaware as far as I know that they are within my stomach. Am I giving them the resources they need to survive? This has interesting parallels to countries meddling in the affairs of other countries to support their own interest. Many countries have histories of propping up dictators, sending help in the form of food or guns, and otherwise providing resources to other organisms we call countries in order to support its own interest. But that’s a different story, but another story in which we are all the same.

I want to provide the living organisms within me which support my life the resources they need, and to starve the organisms which are trying to live in a way which is damaging to the organism I egotistically interpret as myself.

I have no ability to communicate with the organisms living within me (or, do I….). They are no more aware of my existence than most people are of theirs. Yet, where I move, they go. What I feed them, they will eat. If I lose my hand, I will lose my hand, and all of the organisms that go along with it — they will die, just as the cells that I recognize as human will die. To them, I am God, though they do not know me. Crazy — isn’t that exactly how God tends to describe godself?The universe seems unable to stop itself from being a fractal.

Be the god you your body needs. This also comes with awareness that, no matter how well you care for this Universe, you will someday cease to function. Other forms of life (thanks, fungus!) will turn your biological material back into the fundamental building blocks which will allow new and beautiful universes of life to form. So don’t worry or fear death. The building blocks of you will live on forever, as they have lived on forever before you.

However, this begs the question — (did I use that phrase right? I think I did. gosh that’s a hard one to work in appropriately) — is the current extra-dysfunction in some parts of the world resulting in God having some gas, and we’re just the bacteria in the gut causing it? Fractals, right? What makes you think you are on top?

We are truly made of star stuff.
