Something I’ve played around with a bit is exploring the relationship between religions, spirituality, and — for lack of a better word — the real world.

I’ve found, regardless of the **why** (is spirituality and magic just **science** that we don’t know it? is the universe really a conscious being? are we all truly metaphysically connected to each other and everything?), that many spiritual practices work.

In the spirit of not confusing the symbol with the reality, I choose to wholeheartedly accept the symbols without deifying them. The processes work, the symbols work. The pattern behind them is the same — what is it that the pattern is pointing to?

I **think** … **believe?** … bear holy witness too? That this true, the pattern is the only thing we can see, and we can never see the whole, the truth behind it, the symbol behind the pattern. We call that thing God, the Universe, the One, we call that thing Love.

Enlightenment — meditation — prayer — hypnosis — gnosis — these, if viewed as an adjective and not a verb, share some very similar traits. They are a state of being that, unfortunately, can’t be put into words. At least, not by my — there are other wordsmiths who can do it better than me, and I encourage you to find them.
