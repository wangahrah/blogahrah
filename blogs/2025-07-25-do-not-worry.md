I hear the voice in my head — “Do not worry”. I know it is a message from the Divine, from Above. I read it as a child in my book of wisdom, the Bible — do not worry. Trust God.

I know this wisdom rings true through all faiths and not-faiths. It’s a fundamental wisdom of humanity, and it comes from the Divine.

I was not able to learn this lesson until I learned it for myself. My psychology is trained to be nervous, to be afraid, to survive. My worry, the feeling that emerges from this, can cripple me and wound me and stifle my own growth and ability to function.

Though I am afraid, though I cannot help but strive to survive, I learned I must conquer Worry — to understand it and embrace it.

Only then do we learn the ability to be worried, and to not-worry at the same time.

This wisdom came from Above, but it can only be learned from Below.
