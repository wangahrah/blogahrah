Trapped in cycles of abuse. Thinking they are the abuser, but finding myself lashing out in abusive ways more and more. Can I blame them for what is within me?

Working on myself, but not working on the system. A change in one changes the system, right? Falling prey again and again, yet knowing I am not the problem. They are the problem. They are the problem. There could not be two problems.

Knowing I support the system. I play the game. What is support? Enabling? Creating a positive feedback loop. Building a path for the pain to start again. Inviting it to start again. Feeding the system that hurts me. Trying to fix what I did wrong.

Replaying it again and again. Yearly. Monthly. Weekly. Daily. Don’t know I’m doing it. Doing it again and again. Replay again and again. See it all play out the same way. Reset and try again. One of these days we’ll beat the game.

Tired. Exhaustion. Perseverance does nothing except hurt us again and again. Turning away from it. Break the cycle. Don’t reset the simulation. Re-write it.

Stop participating. Fill yourself with compassion. Turn the other cheek. Don’t make the whole world go blind. Your actions ripple out through the universe, creating the model for others to follow. The very act of breaking the cycle frees more than just you. Break it again and again. Make your cycle breaking the cycle. Stop playing.

Abound with joy. Abound with peace. Look to the children. They will teach you how to be, so you may keep them as they are, to be bring healing to the world.
