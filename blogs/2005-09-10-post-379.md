The Night of Facebook.

Friends, we now have access to the Facebook.  I don't know if you
know what facebook is.  But go to www.facebook.com, and sign
up.  I don't know if we're supposed to know we have access to
it.  It's basically an online school directoy/online method of
hooking up.

I'm rather excited about it.

In other news, I completely forget this picture from the zombie
infested house next door.  It's actually haunted zombie poop.

And all this to the melodic background and fore-video sound and visual
of Wayne's World.  Schwing!!!  I watch this movie as often as
possible.  Last year, I'd watched it about a dozen times by this
time.
