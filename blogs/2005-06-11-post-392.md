I've just been an updating FIEND lately, eh???

I'm pretty excited, I'm published!!!

Mine is the "An switch ad spoof for Apple's move to Intel".

They botched the grammar.  Arrgggh.  But MacBytes is a well
known Mac news thing, so I'm excited that it's out there for the world
to see.  Here's a [direct link](http://homepage.mac.com/wangahrah/switch.mov),
oh dear friends.  Be warned, it's a bit tech-heavy, and you have
to be a geek to understand some of it, and be up on the latest
Intel/Apple news to follow the rest.  Either way, I am well
pleased.

In other news, so, um, I met this girl...
