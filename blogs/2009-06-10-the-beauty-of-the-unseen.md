there's some twisted pleasure in a public blog that almost no one reads.    a "freedom" to talk about things that people COULD know about, but don't care to.  just like twitter.

In other news, I think I've solved America's economic crisis, which involves the destruction 0f Walmart, the elimination of lazy people, and the mass removal of criminals from politics.  Who's with me?

Interpersonal relationship dynamics continue to elude me.  If anyone can solve these problems for me, I'd be most grateful. I simply do not get people, and feel a time of introspective hermitage descending on me.  Amazing how hard pure hermitage is when you're actively involved in service and volunteering.

I want to be Calvin again. I already have my stuffed tiger.
