4:43:01 PM: Hey Mike
  4:43:09 PM: one of the girls I work with looks a TON like Laura
  4:43:23 PM: Her name is Carrie Arm
  4:43:42 PM: I think she should date or marry Kerry Hand
  4:44:53 PM: because their names are so similar
  4:44:53 PM: but she's short
  4:44:53 PM: and she has a boyfriend
  4:44:53 PM: her boyfriend does a lot of cocaine
  4:44:54 PM: maybe if you do cocaine, pretty short girls will like you too
  4:48:10 PM: Well, maybe if you just drink Coca-cola
  4:48:21 PM: that is a different, less harmful kind of coke
  4:48:48 PM: if you were in the south, you could just drink dr pepper or something and you'd still be drinking coke
  4:49:28 PM: southern pretty short girls are more likely to like you because every carbonated beverage they see you drink will be a coke
  4:49:35 PM: that's my theory of the  day
  4:49:36 PM: bye
