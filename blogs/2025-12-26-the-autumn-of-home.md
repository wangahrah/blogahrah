I don’t think I’ve ever before lived somewhere that felt like home.

None of the other moves have felt like leaving home. This does.

It’s hard describing feelings that you have a hard time describing. Today things felt more real, even though I’ve been to our new house, walked the land, talked to the lizard and frogs and mushrooms and plants. I’ve dealt with so much of the practical side — the agents and attorneys and a hostile seller, seeing unexpected expenses pop up, try to formulate a plan on how to move a family with dogs and horses and sheep and alpaca and donkeys and ducks and chickens and Tommy the turkey across the country without losing our minds or our lives. It hasn’t been easy.

If the promised land is anything like the kingdom of heaven, it grows from a mustard seed. You sell all you have and grab on to it. I’m not selling everything I have, so I guess this isn’t the kingdom of heaven, but it’s definitely a new home in a place that feels like a distant memory, once called home.

In six years, I’ve changed more than ever before. It certainly wasn’t just me — the past six years have been brutally confusing and scary for the majority of the world, as globally we teeter on what we’re told is imminent destruction from all sides — politically, socioeconomically, spiritually, and even the earth herself seems to rise up against us, threatening us with extermination if we keep threatening her with the same.

This home was an integral part of that. Living, for the first time, with land and animals. Trying (mostly failing) to grow things, keeping horses and smaller critters, poultry, and having three of my own monsters born on our deck. Growing and changing with a spouse grappling with her own self and the world around her, as I grapple with my own self and the world around us.

Now I’m going back to where I grew up, believing in things that are quite different from the community I grew up with. I know we disagree on a great many things. I know those things are deeply held and valuable and can cause great rifts. There are rifts already all over the place, and I don’t know to mend them. Yet I can’t help but feel called to this, so I don’t even think about it. I just do it.
