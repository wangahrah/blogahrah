There’s a lot of interesting self-help stuff on medium. I appreciate that. I enjoy seeing folks who have legitimately found themselves — people who speak highly of the bravery of chucking away your **old life** for **who you really are** and those sorts of things.

I read one article about how to achieve success in your place of self-actualization. They included information about how important mornings were, and how to help us succeed better, we should consciously allow ourselves to enter a **survival** brain space. The specific example they provided was not eating in the morning. the stress of not eating, working, followed by eating as **reward** for working both allows us to enter the survival mindset necessary for us to achieve incredible performance, and allow the natural mechanisms of **food reward** to keep driving us to develop healthy habits.

This person wakes up early, exercises, and achieves success. That’s fantastic, and i’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that approach.

Putting that info out there as the path to success isn’t really the whole story. that was their process — I take minor issue with contextualizing it as something that would be great for everyone. I’ve tried many times to do the wake up early / exercise power combo, and it makes me hate life. I’ve done it past the point it should have moved into the **healthy habit** phase. same with running. i run for months and months, work up to 5–10 miles, and then give up because I hate it.

I think it’s very important for everyone to find their natural rhythm, and when a rhythm is unhealthy, to work to change it — but don’t forget we are, for the most part, individuals, and if no matter how hard you try, something isn’t your thing — maybe it just ain’t your thing.

Lucky for me, the pathway to **my** success — the process that brings me to learn new things each day and make connections in my mind — involves more smoking pot, drinking whisky, and sitting in a hot tub staring at volcanoes than waking up early and exercising.

Wait, am i just going to die early?
