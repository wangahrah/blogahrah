There are always true priests, wizards, pastors, wise men, monks. They know the path of their God, and work with honest hearts to connect people to how God can speak to them. They give to mankind from themselves, and seek nothing in return. They are true believers and disciples. Some are kings. Some are peasants. Some live alone in cities, villages, or wander the land. You will never know for sure who they are. If they insist they are wise, they probably are not. Unless, of course, they are.

There are always charlatans, deceivers, tricksters, manipulators. They know nothing of the path of any god but themselves, and seek to use an illusion of the source to better only themselves. They usually have the trappings of how the world understands a particular aspect of success. If they teach material prosperity, they are a charlatan. If they teach you how to prosper, they may be a charlatan, unless they are not.

The false prophets will increase in number until destruction is assured, and destruction is cyclic, therefore assured. All should always seek to live in such a way as to stop the cycle, or else it will never cease.

At the end, when those who have eyes can no longer see, the foolish man will be indistinguishable from the wise.
