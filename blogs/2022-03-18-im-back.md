It feels good to be back in so many ways, but even better to feel like I'm back as myself. With a greater understanding who I am and how I want to interact with the world.

Really, it's the same as I was before. There was little discovery, only unwinding and rolling back of the bullshit that overwrote my life experiences and tried to replace it with the desired experiences and outcomes of The Other. Other people, systems, institutions, dedicated to their own will and purpose and disregarding mine.

Now I understand my will and my purpose. But like, don't ask me what it is, ok? It's not like I understand it and can explain it, but I can live it. And that's what I want to do - to live it.
