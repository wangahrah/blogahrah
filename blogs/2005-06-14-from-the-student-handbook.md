From the Student Handbook:

I like killing things.  In games.

In other news about rules that people don't consistently break, I have
the job with Apple.  They're taking their merry time;  every
time they said they'd contact me has been a lie.  I always end up
calling or emailing them.  It's slightly irritating and makes for
nerve-wracking times, but if you think about it...what do they really
care?   It's important to me, but not so much to them.

This is my sister, going to prom. She's such a big girl
now....*tear*.  And by big, I mean, taller than 4'9" but shorter
than 4'"11.
