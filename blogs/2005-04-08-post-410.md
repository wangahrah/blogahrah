I must avoid the fireballs called down on me by those who disagree.

It's quite pleasant that the week is over.

I have a hot date tonight.  Well, I'm going out with my sister to dinner.

Really, I'm kind've upset about my computer game situation.  I'm getting really out of practice.  I haven't had time in awhile, and it's ripping me apart.  This time last year, I had multiple 12+ hour gaming sessions during the year. This year maybe I have one 10 hour set.  It's pretty sad. I'm sorry. I'll try harder.  I'm sorry.
