I don’t know anything about healthcare. I do have an opinion on it though, and it seems like it’s a pretty uncomplicated conclusion to come to. To keep things light, I’ll throw in some fun #hashtags, because I hate hashtags.

It feels foolhardy in 2018 to advocate against universal healthcare. I’d be strongly in favor of **true universal healthcare**, (inter-dimensional healthcare is a whole other thing) but it probably would turn out those damn aliens all have preexisting conditions and we’d accidentally bankrupt the universe, though we had the best intentions. #spacediseases

The reasons need to circumvent political reasons, because political reasons by themselves are complete bullshit. Politics (well, just people really) will come up with as many arguments as necessary** **to defend their point of view. It’s just human nature, and totally mainstream these days. It’s become painful clear that #factsdontmatteranymore in news, and the propaganda outlets can spout whatever they want. Construct a cool-sounding argument that sounds reasonable enough and your audience will eat it up. But since they’re doing it, I feel it also gives me #permission to #speakmytruth and generate my own #healthcarepropaganda right here.

So forget about the arguments. Look at the evidence. Other countries have different systems. I’m not saying to look at them again. There are a billion and one places where the data points to systems that are different from ours, but better than ours. I’m saying the research seems done, and the conclusion seems clear. Then again, I though the same thing about #globalwarming…

Again. I’m not trying to be political. I’m trying to be practical, and argue that, even if you are against people getting things for free (which, for the most part, I am too!), I’m not going to cut off my nose to spite my face #spiderface #dundermifflin.

***If it making my own life better with universal healthcare makes someone else’s life better too, that seems like a winning scenario.***

The main argument I hear against universal healthcare is the very America-style “don’t you make me pay for that other dude” argument. If it’s mandatory, it essentially and truly **does** become a tax. You can dress it up however you want, but it effectively is a tax. We don’t like taxes. Seriously. I don’t either. I’d be down with paying taxes if the were used awesomely, but I know they are not.

Anyway — we’re against taxes. If the government demanded you pay $1 more in taxes, but you would only have to pay $10 a month for utilities once that tax was instituted, would you accept that tax?

If so, you’ve already proven you can be pro-tax. If no, good for you. You probably realized that it’s not sustainable. Do you think plenty of taxpayers who are not as savvy as you could be bamboozled into believing in it? It’s just a question of finding someone’s price. If healthcare is a cheaper and much more accessible, that seems like a reasonable price to pay.

Universal healthcare, **if run *somewhat *correctly**, can be efficient. People with enough money to purchase healthcare tend to be the kind of people who purchase healthcare, even though they’ll get real complainy about the price. I understand why they’d complain if freeloaders and extra-sick folks were spiking the prices and ruining it for everyone else. It would bring their prices up, and since they’re going to purchase healthcare anyway, it just means they have to hold their nose and pay more. If given the option, shouldn’t they want to purchase it cheaper within a more efficient system?

It’s cheaper to do healthcare for **everyone** than it is to do…whatever it is that America is doing. Everyone will end up saving money. I don’t know how it would go for the industry though, and I bet that’s a big part of the problem. #lobbyistsaregreat

America has one of the world’s worst healthcare systems. Seriously, it’s total shit. I’m one of those folks who make enough that the government doesn’t deem you worthy of a subsidy. It’s a good problem to have, I understand, and it also allows me to see what the system looks like. I’ve played with the numbers enough, and purchased a *BRONZE* plan, because it seems, no matter what happens in terms of spending, it was a better deal than paying for a **GOLD** plan.

My deductible is about $6,000. My max out of pocket is $12,000. However, there certainly are exemptions to some of these things (like when your wife falls off of a horse and it turns out medical **DENTAL** work is in a different bin, and it’s per tooth with a maximum, and then you fight insurance for 3.5 years to get them to pay *anything*, and then you have to call the state insurance commissioner…wait where was I going with this?)

Anyway, it’s shit to realize that I’m paying $8,400 a year in premiums for luxury of having to pay $14,400 if just I get hurt badly, and just over $20,000 if another family member gets hurt as well.

That’s not insurance. That feels like something else.

For people who can’t afford it, the government gives the money to insurance companies. To private insurance companies, who have lobbyists, who bask in the champagne-filled pools of regulatory capture. The government takes tax dollars and gives it to them. Seriously, I don’t like insurance companies.

Really, I’m not saying we have the worst providers, or even that any particular institution is to blame. Except insurance companies.

My point is, I know if we had universal healthcare, the guy with two thumbs pointing at a spacebar right now would not be paying $20,000 in the unfortunate, but unlikely event of a family medical emergency. But am I willing to place a bet on how unlikely it really is?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not an Obamacare fan. I understand the purpose of the mandate, but as I try and wrap my mind around healthcare, I can’t help but think that charging people a tax if they **don’t give money to a private industry** is really something that should be avoided. Didn’t something happen with banks and mortgages getting guarantees from the government not too long ago? Yeah, I know it’s different, but don’t some parts of it feel the same?

So, listen up, ***the left**** — ****the right*** might be correct on this one. Obamacare wasn’t too great. And now that President Trump and company have waged a bit of war on it, it’s certainly not going to improve. It may have been able to grow and evolve and turn into something wonderful, but if you starve something like healthcare, you’re gonna get some nasty beasts. You can choose to feed it and love it, or you can choose to lovingly kill it.

Obamacare should have been skipped, and we need to set sail for universal healthcare. There are many systems that seem to work. None are perfect. You will be able to find huge issues with any of the systems — that’s a given. It makes it very easy to generate soundbites to convince people it’s worse than what we have now, but those soundbites are misleading when looked at in the greater context.

They work better than what we have now. **Much** better. Let’s do it.

What’s that you say? You don’t trust government to be able to do that? Maybe you need to upgrade your government. If the government is not able to meet the needs of the people, then what is it doing? #levelupgovernment

Also, I don’t want to hate on the concept of insurance too much. It’s ok. But when it becomes a commodity within corporations that pursue financial gain above all, it’s gonna get bad. Insurance can be fine. Insurance, *industrialized*…perhaps we need to talk about getting back to a pre-industrialized insurance society.
