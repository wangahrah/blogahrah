It **feels the same regardless of where I am.** I am at peace. I am insubstantial yet an irreplaceable part of things. All things are one thing, connected intimately. There is something out there speaking — if only we had ears to hear. It guides all things, but few things listen. Home is not a place — it is a state of being.

It **moves through me** as I shed my tears for the world on Rattlesnake Mountain on the Appalachian trail, overlooking the fiery blaze of fall colors in the Northeast. I sit alongside the Lewis River by Moulton Falls in the Northwest, nestled into the centuries-smoothed stone, smothered by green, the world bursting forth with life around me. I feel my heart stop high atop a peak under a glacier in northern Montana, unable from my perch to see the whole world — only the snow-covered tops of other peaks, the world too far below to even consider. Sitting under a mango tree in Haiti, accepting the beauty and peace of this place that permeates and nourishes so deeply, so different from the picture of this place that had been painted for me. I try to catch my breath at 15,000' above sea level overlooking valleys dotted with ancient villages in Peru — does that make it the voice of the Condor speaking directly to me, though I was not yet aware of the existence of that being? Do we need to know what is speaking to us before we will be able to hear?

W**hat is this thing?** How can we connect to this ***sublime***? Is this a feeling or a force? Is it internal? Is it external? I used to feel it in church, worshiping God. I can’t say that it’s not God. At the time, I did not realize this feeling was not exclusive to that religion, but rather something shared by all religions, even the religion claiming not to be one.

I feel moved. I feel connected. I am assured all is One, and all is Well. When the universe was created, it was Good. Who is to say it is Not?

Is this Yahweh? Gaia? The spirits of the ancestors, or the spirits of the trees? Are they they same? Are they in conflict with each other? Do the Gods still battle, the victor rising up with the claim of being the **One True**? Does each force gather their followers, by truth or by lie, by manipulation or by authenticity, supported by the energy of their devotees? Does that make them all evil? Does it make them all good? Can an earthworm sit in judgment over a robin?

Is it a blast of chemicals and electrical impulses in my brain, having me perceive something as if it is, where really it is nothing? The Gods are without a capital G, figments of our mind. A neurological anomaly, a mass delusion, an outdated trait of our psychological evolution? That it doesn't matter what you believe, as long as you believe something?

*The largest horsefly I’ve ever see lands calmly next to me and looks at me. What is your experience, horsefly? Am I a **God** to you? How do you perceive me? What is the state of your soul?*

If **I analyze too much**, rationalize too much, assert my own ego and demand answers, demand to be right, demand to know, I can feel the answers slip farther away from me. Perhaps rational thinking is not the answer to all pursuits. Perhaps the pursuit of pure rationality is the least rational decision that can be made.

The birds sing their songs. The creek bumbles and splashes. This is why we seek something to to fill in the noise. When our spaces are dull and mechanical, humming with electrical noises and compressors and engines, we can no longer hear the voices that have spoken to all things for so long. It may be God, Gaia, or the network of ancient trees, reassuring us we are not alone, pleading with us to stop what we are doing and recognize what we are — does it matter where the voice is coming from if we are unable to hear it?

I struggle to find my calm and peace in the world. I have bills to pay, a family to care for, relationships to make and mend, and a series of endless notifications waiting to notify me. Finding God is a peaceful place, relieving me of my anxiety, giving me the strength and clarity to reassert my priorities. Is this feeling a remnant of my religious upbringing? Why does this sentiment ring true with so many, even those who, when sober, claim there is nothing beyond the rational? Yet, once they are dipped into the pool of the **sublime**, time and time again, the rational skeptic loses their sobriety, wistfully and dreamily discussing how they *really* feel about ***love***and the ***interconnection*** of all things. Even those who do not believe it can see, hear, and drink from the sublime before wandering back to their own flavor of delusion.

In the end, after I consider these things, I must leave them for awhile. I have few answers and more questions. I hope I have learned something from the questions. Maybe not. I won’t know until I spend some time listening to hear God speak instead of reading articles online.
