In April 2019, more conflict was brewing. This time, the focus was on Battle Ground, WA. I-1639, a ballot initiative concerning gun regulation had passed, and second amendment advocates were not having it. The narrative was that the initiative, now a law, was in violation of the United State’s Constitution, and was therefore null and void and should not be enforced. A movement started to declare Battle Ground a Second Amendment Sanctuary City. What did that really mean? No one really seemed to know, legally or practically, but as most political issues, the issue itself is not important to the people driving it — getting voters stirred up is the key.

I had joined a Facebook group called the Battle Ground Red Elephants. I’ve left it since (mostly to preserve my own sanity), and now it’s private. It was part community group, part right-wing liberal-bashing meme factory. Consistent topics were what a shithole California and Portland were, how Hilary was evil, and how liberals were taking over and destroying the country. They believe the government is coming to take their guns if they are not vigilant, that the LGBTQ+ agenda is corrupting their children, and how God and small town values needed to come back to this area. They hated Antifa, the domestic terrorists based in Portland, who were out to get them. There was no need for evidence or facts, with baseless claims being celebrated as victories for Trump against the liberals, and anyone who considered themselves Republic or conservative who spoke out against Trump was thrown under the bus and labelled a closet liberal.

## The Second Amendment Rally

Patriot’s Prayer, with the help of the Battle Ground Red Elephants, organized a rally in the local public park to support second amendment rights. It was advertised locally on radio stations and online. Open carry was welcome — encouraged, really — as they fought back against the libtards and I-1639. There was some political drama involved permits as well — Patriot Prayer didn’t apply for a permit within the appropriate time window, but an expedited permit was granted. Another group contested the permit, but ultimately the rally permit was granted. (You can read about that particular drama [here](https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/news/hearing-held-over-patriot-prayer-permit-for-battle-ground-event/)). The group in opposition was, of course, ideologically opposed to Patriot prayer, and was angrily called out as socialists, communists, and suppressors of free speech. In their words, they were concerned about the movements of outside alt-right forces trying to usurp the local community. Matching that message, Patriot Prayer and the Battle Ground Red Elephants raised flags about the liberal outside forces hell bent on suppressing their free speech.

This was interesting, as Patriot Prayer itself seemed to be, at this time, an outside force, and the group contesting their permit was composed of people within the town — something I have personal knowledge of (though I did not at the time). A consistent tactic of Patriot Prayer is, it appears, to accuse their opponents, with no evidence, of being an outside force trying to oppress them, while using those tactics themselves.

While receiving strong support from an incredibly vocal segment of the community, a larger group was displeased — they were not interested in people carrying automatic rifles in a park with families and children, no matter how much they were assured that a gun-wielding citizen standing next to them was the **safest*** *place to be. Patriot’s Prayer had a permit, and legally, open carry was fine, so nothing could be done.

Of note, Joey Gibson commented, *“..the police are going to have to be there because potentially people from Portland may like to come out here and try to hurt us”.* Later on, as I looked through pictures of the event, I realized the irony of this statement. No one from Portland (in particular, those Antifa terrorists) that I could see came to counter protest, but a good number of people came up from Portland to join in support of the message, several with violent backgrounds. Thankfully, there was no violence — much easier when there is no counter-protest. This town is solidly pro-second amendment and all for free speech. As a matter of fact, so I am, though my rifle is more suited to scaring off coyotes and raccoons than mass destruction.

A continuing message of certain right wing groups seems to be that the Left and Antifa are coming to get them. There’s little evidence for this narrative, but it’s proven effective to help these groups consolidate support.

I showed up with my camera to Kiwanis Park. There were a lot of people there, with tents set up for food and beverages, with folks manning grills to keep everyone fed. Except for the few people who suspiciously confronted me, asking what my views on gun control were (I think they were concerned I was a member of the #fakenews media), and the aggressive right-wing group known as the Proud Boys **on patrol** (their words, not mine), the individuals before the rally were polite and kind. I exchanged a few words with the organizers, and took some pictures at their request of a vintage flag, which I sent to them after the rally. (Note — more recently, the same kind woman in person who invited me to have a snack and asked for pictures has angrily accused me online of being a **beta cuck**. I suppose people lose their ability to control themselves in online discussions.)

Folks were heavily armed. Makes sense for a second amendment rally, but I understand why other locals may have been uneasy with the amount of heat some were packing. I’m thankful to these boys for defending our freedom.

Someone or some group had covered the area in chalk pictures and words of peace and unity before really. I loved the juxtaposition of the words being spoken at the rally and the chalk underneath their feet.

The speakers at the rally, once it began, were volatile and angry. The tone was divisive — drawing clear lines between *us* and *them* as citizens, their group vs. the *liberals*.

Once again, this didn’t seem like a gun rights rally. It seemed like some strange amalgamation of a religious revival with politics thrown in. The focus was still on liberals taking over — and emphasis was placed this time on the spiritual nature of the battle. When Joey took the microphone, he reminded everyone that it’s not the liberal’s fault — they were under the influence of spiritual powers in opposition to God. They were serving Satan, so needed to be looked on with compassion and love. Despite that statement of understanding liberals weren’t the true enemy, you’d be hard pressed to find any other discussion that painted them in any light but as **the enemy**. Topics strayed from gun rights to God to stopping abortion.

I learned that our rights (Second Amendment included, it seems), aren’t given to us by the government — they come directly from God. I learned that “liberals are jerks” (the speaker’s words, not mine), but it’s still OK to love them.

A group dressed in Proud Boys outfits patrolled the outskirts, looking for…something. Perhaps they were trying to ferret out Antifa, or simply strut around proudly. They eyed me several times in a way that didn’t make me feel particularly comfortable. As they were no strangers to intimidation and violence, I was not interested in getting closer to them. That’s what zoom lenses are for.

There were buses with right-wing and Trump themed stickers. I wasn’t sure why there were buses there. Wasn’t this a local event? I assume they were used to bus in folks from out of town — including Portland, as I noticed several individuals based out of the city were present.

The crowd worked themselves up into a fervor. Several times, a caravan of pickups loudly drove by, engines revving and horns honking. Shortly after, a group of roughly high school age boys showed up — members of a local religious sect. None of the elders ever seem to show up — just the younger boys with a reputation for causing trouble. I’d overhead some boys from that group over lunch one day, saying they should bring their guns into Portland to go slaughter liberals — the liberals wouldn’t even have plastic straws to throw at them.

After the rally, the group marched to the center of town with their flags to demonstrate on the corner of Main Street. I, being lazy, drove my car to a nearby lot, and walked to take a few final pictures of the flag waving. That’s where I ran into Steve Drury, who I’d learn more about later. He was smoking pot from a pipe near the Safeway sign, and freely shared some information with me. I didn’t ask — he just shared.

“Do you know how many people are in Patriot Prayer?” he asked. I thought maybe a few dozen, up to a few hundred.

He informed me there were just a few members, including him (for the moment — the relationship would soon be severed), and it was a social media thing. He said they sometimes work with outside groups who approach them with their agenda. Patriot Prayer then assists with community organizing. All members are unpaid, and make their money in other ways.

I found it fascinating he’d just openly share with me what was going on, and that Patriot Prayer is, essentially, the influencer-organizer wing of the alt-right, able to be used by outside groups who align with their ideals to promote their agendas. However, at the time of writing, this, I think Patriot Prayer may have gained enough traction to be setting its own agenda — I doubt they need to rely on contract work anymore. When a movement in the age of social media gains enough followers, it becomes its own force.

At the rally were members of Patriot Prayer, Proud Boys, convicted violent felons, Christian Nationalists, gun rights activists, Trump supporters, and every day folk, out to support second amendment rights. Agree or disagree with the message, it was a well organized, peaceful community event, with diverse folks gathered to support their message — and be given a few new messages.

In a stroke of providence, my wife had a fascinating conversation on the phone while she was looking to have hay delivered for our horses. She’d encountered someone via text who had spoken to her incredibly rudely some months earlier, and refused to deliver hay to us. This round, he agreed. When asked why he was so rude (something my wife is quite adept at dealing with and disarming humorously), he laughed, and said he just liked to piss people off. This man, named Steve, asked her if she’d heard of all the second amendment ruckus going on. He stated he was involved in it because he liked to piss people off. It turned out we’d bought hay from Steve Drury several times, and that he was just as free with distributing information on the phone as he was in person.

I finished up taking pictures, and passed Joey Gibson. I shook his hand, and told him he was an effective speaker and community organizer. The next time I’d speak to Joey in person, he’d ask me if I was a Communist.

Shortly after the rally, the community took a political turn. The Battle Ground Red Elephants, under the leadership of Shauna Walters, spun off a more official organization with the requisite Facebook group — the **North County Sons and Daughters of Liberty **(NCSDL). Their stated goal was to push back on I-1639 and focus on second amendment rights. In the coming months, four political candidates would emerge from this group in an effort to gain real traction in the community.

In the next episode, we’ll see how this movement successfully landed town council seats and how the author got involved with small town politics.
