T**here and Back Again** seemed like the only fitting title for this, but elaborating on **There**, the journey through the deconstruction half, has proven to be much harder than exploring **Back Again**, exploring spiritual reconstruction. So we’ll swap Part 1 and Part 2. Lucky for us, time, like spiritual journeys, seems to be non-linear, so we’ll get there eventually.

Deconstruction is all the rage now, but how new is it? What are the chances that deconstruction is a new umbrella term for something involving seeing the world around us and figuring it out, and folks have being doing it since we figured out how to make rock go smashy to see what was inside. It’s certainly not the lives of toddlers every second of every day. We’ve done a grand new thing.

It’s an inverse from the usual metaphor where the teardown is easy — it’s harder to deconstruct religion than to reconstruct, I think. At least emotionally and intellectually and spiritually. Usually the smashy is the easy fun part, but I found the deconstruction journey to be harder and more painful, trying to find the narrow, overgrown path through the darkness of the jungle, not knowing all paths (and even not-paths) would lead to the same place. It left me with the raw materials and taught me the skills I needed to build something much simpler (at least practically), much healthier, and much more in alignment with **The Universe and Me -**incidentally, the name of my next besteller**.** Through deconstructing and active exploration of spirituality with an open mind, I had spiritual tools, concepts, metaphors, and truths that seemed to be in alignment with the fundamental reality of the universe, in alignment with g/G/ǵ/Ġ/ǧod. I journeyed from life as a fundamentalist christian, through Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Daoism, Magic, all the way to Atheism — to the edge of Mount Doom.

The **There and Back Again** journey is different for everyone. Some people never leave the Shire hobbit-hole of the religion of their youth, while some move far out to the countryside to grow pipeweed, staying culturally connected to the symbols and culture they are accustomed to, but never really exploring anything else. Some journey a bit and find a beautiful place, and settle with the elves in Rivendell simply to hear Hugo Weaving talk. Fewer still journey to the borders of the land which, for them, is uncharted — will you be the one who makes it all the way to the mountain, and cast in what you thought was your Ring of Power, your Religion, your God, into the fires of Mount Doom, gazing deeply into the Abyss, the Nothing, and see what looks back at you?

You’re there. You did it. You made the journey out — and what now? Again, the movie adaptation of Lord of the Rings nails it — it seems to have countless endings. Just when you think it’s over, you flash to a new scene. We have alternative endings too — you can choose to settle in Mordor, to be an atheist, and perhaps you grow some horns and find the heat comforting. Perhaps you were meant to be here all along — this is your place, and when you have examined it without stigma, you have found a new home with like minded people. I think this is wholly acceptable, and in fact, intellectually and spiritually honest and brave. Gold stars all around. But that doesn’t make it for everyone.

So many turn, and head away from the volcano we believed was evil, yet have learned that that which we called evil allowed us a journey to discover ourselves. We needed some evil — real or perceived — we needed a prompt for our journey. We have an opportunity to grow and change, to experience greater emotion, spirituality, and intuition. Is this awakening? We can be grateful for the journey, and I think it’s totally fair to assume that if the Ring of Power, the God we threw into the fiery pit of spiritual criticism is real, the Ring will be tossed right back out at us.

The Ring doesn’t get tossed back out.

When we’re back from our journey, we’re still people, and we need to re-learn to live in the world and engage with it on the new spiritual terms we choose. Our spirituality gives us a sense of grounding in the world, and our religion gives us a forum to interact with other humans spiritually. It doesn’t have to be literally *true* to be healthy for us. Now that you’ve stood on the precipice of Atheism, felt and smelled and breathed and integrated *no god*, you can turn around. If there is nothing (not to be confused with there being a **Nothing**, of which this nothing is a subset), then there is no harm in turning around and finding god.

With the broader definition of truth and a greater cultural understanding we found from deconstructing, we **get to reconstruct**. This has been one of the most fun, rewarding, and alive-feeling journeys I’ve had the honor of embarking on. When we realize that spiritual and natural symbols point back to the greater Reality (some sort of vague amalgamation of all things physical, metaphysical, material, spiritual, and that which binds them together), and we understand we are not able to (nor even should) define it, yet **can** pursue it, we get the freedom to be *alive* with our spirituality.

No one can tell anyone how to deconstruct — but we can share stories and concepts that helped us, and those will help other people. No one can tell anyone how to reconstruct — but we can share stories and concepts that helped us, and those will help other people.

You can pick now. You can cherry-pick now, and no one can tell you that you can’t. You realize now that’s what *they’ve* been doing all along, whether or not they realize it. So pick a religion that works for you — or rather, more importantly, pick *spiritual practices* that work for you. The flavor doesn’t really matter. Did you leave Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, any mainstream religion for any of a slew of reasons, but want to go back to the rituals and community you value, and share your values, but perhaps not your exact beliefs? Do it. Do it for the reasons that are meaningful to you, when you are ready, and trust your resilience. Do you resonate with a totally different style of spiritual practice — meditation, divination, forest bathing, dance? Pick. Integrate. Practice, throw out, iterate. Don’t listen to what I have to say most of all — it was listening to what *other people said* about spirituality that got us into this whole mess in the first place.

The fundamentals of spirituality are strong. You may have already experienced the universality of prayer/meditation/ecstasy/a state of gnosis. If these are tools or rituals to connect us to another and enter a place of — what’s the right word? Altered state? Communion with God? Ecstacy?Oneness with nature? Then why not engage with a multiplicity of practices to best connect you with your sense of spirituality?

Engage with spirituality with knowledge of yourself. Do you love rocks and crystals and candles? Actively engage with them in your spiritual practice. Set up your shrine. Pick what shiny rock feels right — by how it looks, how it feels in your hand, or trust the universe and pull a stone out of your basket at random. Look into it to discern the mysteries of the whole universe, or use it to discern how you really feel about that cute girl. These objects are symbols that act as mirrors, fulfilling our deep-rooted need for rituals to assist in both our introspection and our connection to others.

Are you a hunter? Hiker? Drape-yourself-across-a-rock-by-the-water-er? Spend time outside and be quiet. Look at the water, the leaves, the trees. Look at the desert sand and marvel at how tenacious life is, how it always finds a way. You’ll start to hear and see and feel patterns of life that are universal — they touch on your spirit, your emotions, your own body. You can watch chickens and see how their cultures are not so different from humans, witness the emotions and deeply varied personalities of horses, and realize we’re all made of the same stuff.

Really, most importantly — touch grass. Nature exists, most likely, and is stunningly beautiful. You don’t need to worship it, but you can celebrate it. This is a fundamental way humans can experience ecstatic states and connections to the Universe. No religion owns it. The way a spider spins a web, the arrangement of petals in a flower — these all point us to some Reality. We can’t really talk about it, but we can hear it and feel it when we are present.

Understand the tension between the polarities of ecstasy and ritual. The chaos of uninhibited dancing vs the highly polished ritualist dance — both serve a purpose and a need. Your journey to the edge was a journey of chaos. Your journey to reconstruction is the opposite — a restructuring of order for yourself. You can pick your symbols and archetypes too — and change them as you yourself change.

Jesus presents an archetype that can be compatible with this, as does Buddah, as does meditating by that really cool tree by where you live that you nicknamed the Wishing Tree. It **is **a wishing tree. You made it that. It’s a way of thinking and living, a philosophical and spiritual base from which we can grow, based on a archetype that is so deeply embedded in our human-ness that we can’t explain it, and probably sounds a little weird to someone else. Everyone doesn’t need to deconstruct everything — both impossible and impractical. For societies to flourish, they need shared values, and I hope we can realize the underpinnings of (most) religions are shared. We don’t need to search to find shared core values — we already have them. The values which are not shared should be extra-critically-examined, and as we look at other practices and cultures, we can increasingly recognize what harm we cause each other through the establishment of mainstream, structured religions with dogmatic codes oppressing the **other** and controlling those within. Those ways are in opposition to the universal truths that bind us together at our core — yet simultaneously, they **need** to exist in order for order to exist at all. Somehow, like the tippy top of a tree reaching for the sky, the thing that pushes the envelope towards **order** is the same mechanism that destablizes the whole thing and causes conflict, leading it to ultimately collapse back into chaos.

From the primordial ooze of spirituality and human-ness grew religion. The progressive new growths from this ooze evolved into a variety of religions, but based on shared spiritual practices. When you deconstruct to this, and realize at the same time you are a living being connected to all things, you can reconstruct, rebuild, and have the freedom of a spiritual practice that can change and evolve, just as you change and evolve, dear friend.
