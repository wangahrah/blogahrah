## From Street Brawling to Town Takeovers, Part 1

![](/media/2020-05-30-medium-7c8165d1.jpeg)

In 2018, I started following the movements of some local alt-right movements, Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys. It was easy, since where I lived in the Pacific Northwest seemed to be one of the focal points of the alt-right and Patriot movements. I live in a small, rural town of 1500 people, which, later on, turned out to play a surprising role. These groups have gained attention on a national (and international stage). This is the story of someone who lives here, living and observing the heart of it.

There was no clever infiltration or cloak-and-dagger manipulations. I only had to join my local Facebook groups and go to rallies with a camera as a freelance journalist. I attended town council meetings, talked with people I live with one-on-one, and had online conversations. I focused mostly on staying neutral — surprisingly difficult to do, as the few times I made my voice heard, I immediately had my motivations and ties called into question (and, on one occasion, found a member of the right assuring his group I could be *flipped!).*

I fancy myself a centrist, and I didn’t come in with any agenda except to learn. Well, not entirely. If I had any agenda, it was to discern if there was any way to heal the division running rampant throughout my community (and indeed, throughout the world). Spoiler alert — at the end, I learned what we all already know.

We are all human, and what ties us together is stronger than then manufactured lies that seek to drive us apart in order for a few to gain power. If you gain anything from this story, I hope it is a transformation of perspective. The one you believe to be your enemy is just a reflection of yourself.

This story assumes some familiarity with the subject matter in terms of what is more broadly reported. The Proud Boys, Joey Gibson, and Cider Riot are perhaps already familiar to you. My intent is to shed light on what’s happened on a more local level, so I leave out many of the more broadly reported details.

My first event was the Patriot Prayer rally at Washington State University in Vancouver, WA on October 22nd, 2018. This was, ostensibly, to protest I-1639, a gun control initiative which would be passed by a popular vote of the people in November 6, 2018. I’d never heard of this initiative before, but it would become the narrative that drive a political wedge into our region over the coming year. The rally was not particularly well attended (most likely due to Washing State University shutting down the campus the day of the rally), and I noted a strong police presence ready to spring into action if necessary.

I was not aware a the time, but now I give kudos to WSU for recognizing how this groups works — their primary method is to create conflict to raise awareness of what they’re up to, and provoking the other side into violence is their best case scenario. This is not my opinion — it’s been stated directly by members of these groups, and seems fairly obvious if you observe their tactics. They are trolls — both online, and in real life. Their best work can only be done when there is an opposing force to fight against — the louder their opponents, the better.

I came on to the scene and listened to what the leaders of the rally had to say. I was taken aback at the angry, inciteful tone. I was not aware of who these folks were at the time, but would later find out it was Tusitala “Tiny” Toese and Joey Gibson, both of Patriot Prayer (though that would soon change, after Tiny’s felony assault charges).

*My first time seeing Tiny and Joey*

There was little focus on I-1639 itself, and they seemed to mostly discuss how the government was corrupt, not of the people, and the importance of gun ownership for all the usual reasons, with a whole lot of God and Jesus thrown in for reasons I wasn’t quite sure of. There were complaints about billionaires funding the initiative, and how mental health checks were a violation of our rights to privacy under HIPAA.

It was not particularly coherent, and it seems like a performance that would have been much better suited to a larger rally with counter-protesters screaming in opposition. This was theater and optics, not reasoned political argument and protest. In the moment, I laughed. These movements — or, at least this rally — was a joke.

I was not alone in my assessment. I overheard two older gentlemen behind me, who had come to support gun rights, voice their frustration with the tone of the rally.

“That was a bunch of incoherent babble”.

“No, no, no. This isn’t going to accomplish anything. These young kids just sound angry and are going to stir up more trouble. This isn’t going to fix anything. It’s just going to make things worse”.

*Not all 2A supporters appreciated Patriot Prayer’s tone*

There were a few left-wing counter protestors who, afterwards, spent some time getting into yelling matches with protestors. There was no violence, just a lot of yelling, derisive laughing, name calling, and cameras. Many, many cameras — and I can’t say that I wasn’t part of that problem. I learned how easy it was to tell a misleading story with the pictures — to make events seem much angrier and crowded than they really were.

One of my favorite protesters, who I would run into again a long time later was there, dancing as her form of peaceful protest to overcome the hate.

After the rally, I walked around campus. Right next to the rally was a pole with writing in many languages, stating “May Peace Prevail on Earth”. A carved totem had the following inscription — poignant, considering what had just happened, and what would continue.
