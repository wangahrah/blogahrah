A stick floats in the water. It’s alone, and it’s half wet. The other side is dry, so that’s nice. But it’s lonely.

It runs into another stick. They are side by side. They are still half wet, but they are not alone. Other sticks run into them and join, as sticks will do. They are all half wet, but they are not alone. They are happier.

One stick wants to be less wet, and convinces other sticks they want to be less wet too. Instead of a mass of sticks floating side by side, they pile on top of each other. The ones at the top are not wet, but the ones at the bottom are more wet. The weight of the ones at the top is so much that more are wet at the bottom than at the top. The dry ones are happier, the middle ones are confused as to where the sun went, and the ones at the bottom are wetter and sadder.

Some kind of ape saws trees into planks. The planks float.

The same story is told.

---

The planks who are dry know those at the bottom are wetter and sadder. They work together to build a small dock. Though some are more wet than dry, they see the sun, and are happy to support so many of their kind who are all dry and happy, and all see the sun.

A storm comes. Water comes in through the sides of the dock. In desperation, the dock does what it needs to survive. It boards up the sides. Many planks are wet, many cannot see the sun. Some planks at the top are sad at the plight of their kin, and some content to be dry and happy, in spite of the circumstances.

Much time passes. Sometimes storms come and rough waters. The docks become boats and platforms. Some plunge beneath the surface forever, convinced to support the wood that wanted to be dry. This wood was always wet, and sad, and never seeing the sun, and being so far away that this just became life, and is never thought of again. Some are all wet and sad sometimes, even though they see the sun, and yet now some who see the sun and are dry aren’t happy, but at least they aren’t wet.

Much time passes. Wood decays. All that is left is a stick, floating in the water. It was half wet and half dry.

down the river was a pontoon raft. all the wood was dry and happy, and could always see the sun
