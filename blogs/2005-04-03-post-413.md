First of all, for those who didn't quite catch the subtle reference I gave in my last post to "happy freakin april fools",  happy freaking april fools.  Which is to say, my post on April 1st, ie  April Fools day, was a joke.  Which is to say, it's not true.  Which is to say, I'm not leaving the 'ville just yet.  Which is to say, I'll be here next year.  Which is to say, Laura, you should have picked up on that instead of posting on the next post that you would miss me.  But I'll miss you as well, over the summer.

First of all again, I'm a little upset.  Me and Leah are apparently dating, and I haven't seen her in at least three days.  She should have been aware that we need to see each other at least every 5 minutes, and sit across each other staring deeply into each others eyes.  So if anyone sees her, tell her I miss her terribly.  Tell her I'm lost without her.  Tell her I don't care who she is, where she's from, what she did, as long as she loves me.  And that IIIIIII will always love her.  That every step she takes, every move she makes, every vow she breaks, I'll be watching her. Yeah, thats right.

One of my other friends Mary told me that her mom was scared of me.  I don't know why.

And, in closing, I like to sneak into girls bathrooms.
