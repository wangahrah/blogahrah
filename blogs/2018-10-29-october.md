we have been through this so many times

nothing new, nothing changed

never understanding why they can be so blind

but fully understanding how they can not see

the hate drove us so drives us

you are blind

open your eyes to what we are

who you are

you think we are different

your hate whispers *difference *in your ear

we are the same

you are blind

we have always been the same

embrace and grieve as you find who you are

what you have killed is yourself

if we are the same

it will never end
