On Wednesday, June 3rd, while Black Lives Matter and allies marched in cities, protesting for an end to systemic racism amid cries to defund the police, Patriot Prayer gathered on on the corner of Main Street and 503 in Battle Ground, WA, as they have many times before.

They waved their flags, proudly showed off their handguns and assault rifles and wore their Patriot Prayer apparel. They flew America flags and a Thin Blue Line flag (the first I’d heard of it — read more about it [here](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/09/the-short-fraught-history-of-the-thin-blue-line-american-flag-309767))

Cars drove by, mostly honking and waving. This time, though, there were an increased number of cars rolling down their window to scream “Fuck you!”. Why the change?

Shortly before the event, someone named Mickey Nimaj asked some questions about the event in local Facebook groups in support of the vigil, indicating that she would come. From her Facebook profile and recent statements, she was a local black woman moved here from Houston, complaining about the local rednecks and the homophobes in Texas in an expletive-ridden comment — someone who seemed like they would clearly be in support of a Battle Ground Black Lives Matter protest.

The unfortunately reality of Mickey Nimaj is that she isn’t real. She’s a fake profile, created by the organizer of the event, in attempts to make it seem more legitimate with the support of a person of color. Local PoC had been contacted and invited by this fake profile, with the assumption they’d be more likely to come, vs being invited by a heavily armed white dude.

I can’t draw conclusions about if the motives were good or bad, but we can agree the approach was wildly incorrect, insensitive and tone deaf. Black Lives Matter and allies didn’t show up because they didn’t feel it was safe, plain and simple. Why **wouldn’t **the feel comfortable around heavily armed men with violent associations?

We have few people of color in this community, and the ones who lived here were afraid they were being baited into a potentially dangerous situation. With the connections to violence in Portland and associations with groups like the Proud Boys, I don’t blame them. But truly, I don’t see see race as the primary issue. Many far right groups are, in this day and age, quite racially diverse.

Cultural diversity is quite another matter.

The organizer was outspoken about wanting a vigil for everyone — however, the only people who showed up are the people he associates with most — and they are not particularly on the side of Black Lives Matter. I’ll discuss this in another article, but I don’t believe racism is the primary driver — the religion of politics is, and BLM is the enemy of their political religion. You can hear the organizer speak his platform here. It’s primarily focused on second amendment rights, but seems to actively advocate for all. He has also, after this vigil, attended a BLM event in the same location to show solidarity. He is not a member of Patriot Prayer.

I had a conversation with this man flying the Thin Blue Line / Blue Lives Matter flag. He initiated it — not me.

He said how it was a damned shame what happened to George Floyd, that no one should die like that. He knew the cop had a bad history. He knew a lot of cops have bad histories, and he wishes they would get shoved out. He hypothesized as to if police unions were the problems, and if there was any way to reform our police to be able to get rid off the bad apples. He wasn’t suggesting this in a way that absolved the police of any blame — he believed the police were a necessity for a well-functioning society. He was on the side of police, because he feels police are necessary, while acknowledging systemic issues that need to be fixed to bring justice.

The truth is — many of these people who are on opposing sides don’t particularly have opposing beliefs. They’ve chosen different sides. The more I talk to people on different sides of the line — Blue and Black — the more I hear the same messages repeated. All lives matter — but we’re talking about Black Lives Matter for obvious reasons. If you aren’t aware of those reasons, go check out one of a million memes explaining it.

This is not a statement to say both sides are morally equivalent. It’s an expression of, and search for, some solidarity that few seem to be able to see right now.

We need to find ways to start conversations. I’ve been paying attention to the local right wing movements like [Patriot Prayer](https://medium.com/@pavlovschicken/how-patriots-prayer-became-a-political-force-e612e61f55d3), and how they’ve consolidated their supporters. That support **is** consolidated, but it feels like followers are now trapped within a bubble of social media news bias — as well as cultural bias.

I believe in extending olive branches and having conversations. Not yelling at each other — or, more accurate to the time we are in, typing furiously at each other. All hail, the noble keyboard warrior.

Get out there. Protest. Protest with a group you don’t believe in. Hear their stories. Have conversations with humans. Tell me I’m wrong.
