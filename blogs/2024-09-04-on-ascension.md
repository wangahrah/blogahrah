Ascension is the marker, but not the goal. Striving for ascension is a recipe for failure to ascend.

Ascension is something that grows by itself. It’s a tree, and you can sort of turn it around so the sun faces it a certain way, and maybe move it around a little, but you really need to just foster a healthy soil and environment for it to grow.

For us unfortunately not plant-based and a bit more human, we don’t need to focus on ascension, or getting better, or finding ourselves, or anything like that. All the things that we truly do want to achieve, and truly are noble achievements, are something that just happens when we allow them to.

The most active work that needs to be done isn’t focused on above, on what we want to achieve. The most active work that we need to do is looking downward, inside of us, descending. Finding what is hurting us, finding out what is holding us back, taking a hard look at ourselves and asking the hardest question to ourselves: what if I’m wrong? A bit more disturbing is: what if I’m wrong, and I’m blind to the knowledge that I’m wrong, and I still think I’m right?

Look inward and downward and find what’s hurting you and what’s holding you back. Hurts and mistreatments from the past shape your brain and your life, but you’re a lot more plastic than you think. The deeper it’s buried, the harder it can be to find. When you find it, you don’t even have to, root it out and destroy it. Just hang out with it. Give it some space and listen to it. It’s a part of you, but it doesn’t make you what you are. Acknowledge it as a part of who you are and thank it. I think really often, it’s just trying to keep you safe, and that should be appreciated.

The better you are at downward work, the better you’ll get at upwards work. You gotta get a little dirty bro.
