A meditation for myself, as I often lose my way

Breathe and seek Him

Breathe and search

Why do I fail

Where are you

---

Why is the child so hard to find?

You are there and are me

You know what is true

You know the path

You always have

Take one step

Listen to Him

Listen to Me

Listen.

Is this your path?

Is this your calling?

If only you could hear

If only you even knew he exists

---

The Law is written on our hearts

Have we learned to read?
