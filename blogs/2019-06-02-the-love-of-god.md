God accepts you for who you are. That does not mean you are who you need to be.

God meets you where you are. You need not be ashamed. Do not hide from the light. It will show you who you need to be. You do not need to flee if it is not who you are today. You will have the time you need. Perhaps we can never achieve our own fulfillment, and the journey is the thing.

Be open to growing. God does not need to create you in the image of God — you were created in the image of yourself. That in itself is a reflection of God. Who you need to be is what you were made to be.

You must meet God. Speak to God. You cannot learn from a book or from another. God is everywhere. If you seek, you will find.
