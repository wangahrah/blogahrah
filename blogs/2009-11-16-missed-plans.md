i had planned on blogging about:

-the new rats i saved

-my work situation (in abstract terms; you ain't using my online words against me)

-my life/love situation

-thoughts on marketing/advertising

-thoughts on 'just living' vs fully examining situations, and if you can TOO FULLY examine a situation

-taxes

-some people that i non-romantically love

but i didn't write about ANY of those things!
