Sometimes a good argument gets me all riled up and ready to go. In a good way.  It's been a real long time since I had a great, non-emotionally-involved argument.  Something no one is personally invested in, but you see very differently.  I get pretty heated and into a debate. Sometimes people think that mean I'm angry, taking things personally, or holding things against the other person.  Couldn't be farther from the truth.  It's just my style.

I'm trying to pull my life back into proper balance.  I do struggle with anxiety.  Overally, it's a chronic, mellow thing, only rearing its ugly head when there are specific, pointed triggers...lately there's been multiple blunt triggers, and it's been doing me in.  Not enough sleep, eating terribly, turning to soda to drown my sorrows...these destroy me.  It'd be better for me to turn to alcohol than soda...caffeine gives me wicked anxiety problems after an anxiety session has been triggered.  I NEED to regulate myself to go to bed early and get plenty of sleep, and I need to start being more active too.  I've already started eating healthier, cutting out caffeine and excess sugar.  Makes me feel better overall, be healthier, and keeps my heart rate at a reasonable level.

A final note on trying to debate things with management:
