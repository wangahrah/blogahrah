I've decided to undertake a great task to benefit mankind.  All
the time, we see those "Get blah blah free if you shoot Santa with an
iPod shuffle with a free DVD player with built-in nanotechnological
database computer wire chapstick".   We're not dumb, so we
ignore them.  I bet at the top of this Xanga, there's probably one
of those.  I don't want you to be an idiot; they don't work.
I'll be the idiot.

If you see a "free" site somewhere that you don't want to sign up for,
but you'd be interested in, let me know.  I'll try it first, even
if I have to enter credit card information.  So far I can tell you
that any site run by FreePay, formerly known as Gratis, is legit.
That doesn't make it easy.  But it does work, and you will recieve
your free...iPod, flatscreen monitor, or even designer handbag.  [http://www.freepay.com ](http://www.freepay.com%20)will get you started there. Actually, to show your gratefullness to me for doing this, sign up at [http://flatscreens.freepay.com/?r=22309957](http://flatscreens.freepay.com/?r=22309957%20)
and help me get a free flatscreen monitor.  You'll need to
complete one of the offers, which are anything from a free trial for
weight loss stuff, to credit card offers.  All of them are legit;
the credit card I use now I got through this, and I sent my dad some
Hydrodermâ„¢ stuff in the mail.  Then, I cancelled before I got
billed after the free trial was over.  Some of them are completely
free; some places charge you a dollar.  I think that's not a bad
deal, for a free thing.  Other conditions apply on individual
offers.  Depending on what you want, (all the products are listed
on the homepage) you need to get between 3-10 friends to sign up under
you and complete an offer, and complete an offer yourself.  The
higher the value on the free product, the more people need to complete
offers on it.

Next on the list is offers through Peel.com, like [freeplaystation.peel.com](freeplaystation.peel.com)
I signed up through this one, and basically its the exact same business
model as FreePay sites.  Since it is, I would say with a fair
amount of certainty it would work...but why not just stick with
FreePay, cause we know that works.

Final word for today is [http://www.lookdog.com/](http://www.lookdog.com/)
I was fairly excited about this, as it said you need to do six offers,
as do the other sites...but you could complete it yourself!  I
settled in for the ride to get a PSP.  It had three pages of
offers, with 2 offers needing to be completed per page.  I banged
out a few offers right away, nailing myself a $25 WalMart card and $20
Loews Home Improvement gift card.  I'll keep you posted later on
if those come through.  I got to the last page, and BAM, theres
the kicker.

So you need to buy either a) Two satellite dish services (with free installation and equipment and the first month FREE!!with a 18 month commitment and a minimum plan cost of $30 a month. Or, you can get a satellite dish servicewith a 18 month commitment and a minimum plan cost of $30 a month with
an auto loan.  And the loan needs to be approved and all that fun
stuff before you'll get credit for it being done.  Verdict?
Nope!  Looked good, but they nail ya in the end.

All in all, I bet it will be pretty fun.  Even if it costs me a
few dollars in the end.  Nice people will send me a few dollars
through PayPal to wangahrah@mac.com.

Anyone want my free 1 month trial of America Online?  You have the sweet screen name RahWangah.
