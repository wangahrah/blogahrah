It is strange that one can adopt a new theory of living in a single day, but take a lifetime to train one’s self into that new belief system.

Even when we think we have matured into our life philosophy, we are adept at deceiving ourselves into truly thinking we live according to our stated belief systems. Too many times, we honestly believe our actions and beliefs are in harmony, while being blind to our own deep hypocrisy.

The ego speaks words of belief, but the self has patterns developed over time. The ego can change its words quickly, but the self must be nurtured and molded into assimilating those new thought patterns into a lifestyle.
