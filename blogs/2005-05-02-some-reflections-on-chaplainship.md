This post is entitled, "Some Reflections on Chaplainship", and is dedicated to [Debbi](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=spacegirlspiffy)
and is not a Fluffy Postâ„¢.  Just some things I was thinking about,
lying in bed, then realized hey, it's only 1:21 (when this started
being written) and it doesn't matter if I have circuits at eight.
Here's some random, valuable lessons learned.  And maybe you can
learn something too, or have something to think about.

Some things first:

- A lot of work goes into chapel.  (duh)

- If you put a lot of work into chapel, "chapel sucks" becomes a
personal attack, and can really become upsetting.  This isn't
necessarily all a bad thing; chapel may in fact "suck", and that may
very well be a reflection of what I or whoever ran/spoke at/led
selected sucky chapel's ability to do chapel.  However, saying it
at other times is simply a bad thing.

-Stated sucky chapel may not in fact suck.  You may just not like it.

-Love covers over a multitude of sins.  If love can cover that,
can it also cover over a boring speaker, or a unstellar musical
performance?

With that said...I personally became extremely discouraged about
chaplainship fairly quickly.  Chaplains (or at least me) recieve a
good deal of what I call "hate mail".  It's not fair to call it
that; a small portion of it really is constructive, and even though it
pointed out flaws or things that could be improved, I really appreciated
it.  Most of it, though, is, "I don't like how you do this", or "I
think this is bad".  Not in constructive ways; simply in ways
people don't like and they feel the need to express their
opinions.  Again, nothing necessarily wrong with that; but, for
some reason, it's not just expressed as opinions.  It's expressed
in biting and/or sarcastic remarks.  Very, very little
encouragement is recieved, and I was hugely, hugely blessed by those
who sent me a smile face or words of encouragement.  It kinda
works the opposite of how its supposed to...those small encouragements
balance out a dozen negatives.  They're ubercool.

So, it seems people are typically critical.  We all know this
isn't christian love; I'm not going to lecture about that.  But, I
love God, and I do my best to follow where he's leading me, whether it
be for or against popular opinion or style.  I would venture to
say that is safe to say about the majority of our chapel speakers as
well.  So, if love covers over all those sins, doesn't it cover
over our dislike of chapel style, or chapel speaker?  Do we have
to point out how bored we were with the chapel speaker, or can we say
"Hey, it weren't my style, but dag yo, I'm so glad he cares so much
about God and wants to express it."  Some people grew a bit weary
of "Light in the xxxxxxx", thought it superficial, and not what they
needed.  Yeah, I felt the some way at times; but is there a need
to be biting or rip it apart?  I think everyone agrees Billy B is
a solid guy, and we like him.  Let's praise God for having a stud
as prez and who speaks the truth as some people really do need to hear
it.  People sometimes have a habit of skipping Rohm's chapels, all
of them.  Is it really the end of the world to sit through
something you don't like?  Do you even listen to what he
says?  There is a lot of truth there, whether you're brain is
online with him or not.

I'm doing a poor job of trying to get out whats in my head.
Experiencing being chaplain gives a new perspective of encouragement
and criticism.  I have a hard time criticizing  speakers
now.  This isn't to say if they have a flagrant system error, I
don't say "Hey now, you be wrong."  Definitely  done that a
few times.  But God judges the heart...look at the heart of the
speakers.  If someone messses up a word and uses a completely
wrong phrase in chapel...yah sometimes its funny, especially when it
means the completely opposite of what they were trying to say.
But you KNOW what they were trying to say; why can't you take that and
run with it.  It could just as easily be you up there lookin like
a tool.

I keep getting off track.  Think about chapels, more importantly,
chapel speakers.  Be broken enough not to whine about it, to see
if they are genuine in their passion, and rock-solid in their
truth.   Pray for them!  If they're not the most
exciting speaker, get over it and listen to what they have to
say.  It'll build your character.  There's better things to
whine about.  For me, I whine about things like Foundations class,
which really undermines my point anyway.  I'm not saying all
chapel speakers really are worth listening to...just, think about if
they are a little more thoughtfully, with a little stronger dose of
thought, and a lot stronger dose of love.

Jon Kragel is next years chaplain for Class of '07; I don't know what
the other ones are, but you'll all find out soon.  Jon's email is
jrkragel@cedarville.edu .  That's especially important after next
year gets rollin.  Bless his chaplainship; volunteer to do
things.  Be friendly to him.  Send him encouragement.
It's difficult being a leader; things I would casually discuss with my
friends suddenly must be researched for hours in order to make sure
every word I would speak in front of my class was completely accurate;
how dare I presume to misinterpret God's word when a little more study
would have shown the truth.  How dare I give God less than 100% of
my passion for doing it and my mind in speaking the Truth. Think of how
those who speak have to deal with that burden.  And love each
other.
