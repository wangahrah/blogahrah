No, I didn't go to Elliv.  But I'm sure you looked beautiful.

In other news, for a long time our Dean of Students, Kirsten Gibbs, looked really familiar, which was strange because I didn't know her at all.  I didn't even know who she was.  Just seeing her around made me raise an eyebrow.  Something was oddly familiar.  Since this is Cedarville, I don't know how many of you will understand the true significance of this, but hey, why not?

There ya go.  Kirsten Gibbs, or should I say, MOLLY SHANNON, you have been found out.  We know where you are hiding.  But I suppose I'll give her the benefit of the doubt; maybe they're just identical twins.  We'll go with that.  I wonder if the administration reads our blogs.  That would mean they have no life, too.
