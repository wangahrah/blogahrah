[This is my new blog](http://homepage.mac.com/wangahrah/iblog/index.html).
Most of you won't care at all.  I bet none of you will.  And
less than none of you will understand it.  uberMac geeks
only.  Tell your hot sisters about it, and they'll be impressed
with my computer hacking skills.  Don't worry, for you commoners
who don't understand it, this blog will still be updated.  Need to
keep the masses happy so I'm not impeached.

Here's a picture of when I used to do social things like go to other towns proms.

And apparently I'm not currently reading or watching anything because of a flagrant system error.

Edit: I'm tired of not finishing the whole free iPod thing.  Go here.

Complete an offer.  Finish this thing for me. Need 2 more referrals.  It's not a joke.
