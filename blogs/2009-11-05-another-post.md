Two posts in less than twenty four hours, I'm on a crazy writing streak.

Maybe I'll start writing in the mornings. Maybe it's good for me!

Yesterday, I felt so drained and wiped out.  Probably a combination of work stress, financial 'stress' (funny how though money isn't a problem, feeling like I have to spend too much stresses me out), and my girlfriend being gone again, coupled with the fact that I normally need a decent amount of alone time, and I hadn't got that in a long, long time.  Well, if a few weeks is a long time.

I feel rested.  I slept through the whole night, I think...that's not super common.  I felt exhausted when I woke up...and recall actually saying to myself, "Get out of bed, you turd".  How's that for self loathing, eh.

My brain and body are tired of being tired and stressed.  Today, they instructed me to be happy, and I am.  Retaining my love for everrryyything today will be high priority, and I feel optimistic and ready to LIVE.  Funny, cause today is a NORMAL DAY.  So I'm going to LIVE a NORMAL DAY.  But staying content during that...that's something that's often way too hard to achieve.  Eye before eee.
