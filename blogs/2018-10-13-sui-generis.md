I sought answers and threw my mind out to the universe.

Now that I have left the faith of my youth, I did not expect answers. Now I am a heretic. Why did I feel that as I left my faith in pursuit of truth, feelings of spirituality and connectedness increased? Why did I begin to experience joy and reality in a whole new way? Why as I pursued the truth did I feel it pull away from me?

The answer came to me as no other answer has.

“You will never know the truth, but never cease the pursuit.”

So I pursue.

Things always change — this is unchanging. It always has been, and always will.

We have been created in God’s image? What a beautiful picture. How we change and evolve! How we think we are static, fixed, unchangeable — how we tell people, *This is just who I am!*

Things always change. We deceive ourselves when we think we cannot change. Even if we choose to not change, we are changed.

We are created in God’s image, and God always changes.

As we pursue, as we find answers, the answers draw farther away from us. This cycle continue, again and again. Perhaps through reincarnation. Perhaps through ascending through spheres of consciousness. Perhaps our consciousness dissipates, but the actions of our lives fundamental change the structure of reality — though we cease, we leave part of ourselves as the changing legacy of the universe. Whether the Divine is spiritual or mathematical, does it matter?

It does not matter. Every religion need not be true. Every religion need not be false.

We all have the spark of the divine, and this is as meaningful as it is meaningless. It is not necessary to understand our spark, to work miracles, to be able to speak to God as Moses did, to follow the regulations and laws of humans in order to come to union with the Divine.

The Universe is a dazzling fractal. Study one thing deeply — you will learn more than you could imagine about other domains, and the universe as a whole. Secrets lie hidden everywhere. Some in plain sight — some require a lifetime of dedication to unravel.

Men rise and fall. God rises and fall. Gods rise and fall. A part of everything is eternal — nothing will ever truly cease to exist. Our matter and energy are exchanged.
