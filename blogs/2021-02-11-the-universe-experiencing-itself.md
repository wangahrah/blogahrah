We learn by doing. We do things, almost at random, until we find something interesting. When we find something interesting, we increase our focus on it until it seems chaotic. When the chaos reveals order within itself, we move to the next level. We learn more. Our skills improve. It’s natural and intuitive. A child has no purpose in their experimentation — it’s for the sheer joy and excitement of learning.

It’s evolution. It’s life. It finds a way. It doesn’t have biases. It finds biases. It doesn’t follow trends. It sets the trends.

We are limited in the number of experiments we can do by our own minds. We can’t consciously think about every variable, eventuality, or system connected to our current experiment. The best we can do is simply our best — keeping an open mind, and incorporating others’ experiences to the best of our ability. We may pick a single topic, attempt to control for perhaps a half dozen variables, and pat ourselves on the back when we come to a firm conclusion, ignoring a billion other untouched variables and being wholly unaware of a whole subset of systems dramatically influencing our subject.

The **Universe **has no such limitations, and runs infinite numbers of experiments simultaneously. These experiments have no inherent goal — they are experiments of existence. They **are **existence. Things are in a constant state of flux, creatures being born and dying, planets being born and dying, stars and galaxies and possibilities birthing and being born and dying.

There are approximately eight billion human experiments existing on earth, each with a related but different experience. This is how a Universe experiences and experiments with human-ness. Subtle nuances of feeling and experience compared to others are invisible to you, but present in the greater Universe of human experiences collectively shared. You had no control over your birth, and most humans experience a sensation of having little control over their own lives — indeed, some of our best advice is that we cannot control our situations, only our reaction to the situations we find ourselves in.

Our least-effort-existence should be this — to understand and harness our reactions, but to accept the experience of the Universe that we are in, and **share it with others**. We experience, all of us, extreme pain, loneliness, joy — the reasons for which we feel them are different, but the feelings are the same. This great experiment of the Universe, imbuing itself into our flesh, allows us to see how tightly we are knit together by **how we experience things**, but it seems we would rather focus on **different things that we experience** and create conflict from it.

---

Perhaps that’s another important lesson from this experiment — differences in experience lead to conflict. But why? If we fundamentally **feel** the same things, why would we choose conflict? Perhaps we don’t have a choice. Perhaps there are outside forces influencing us to choose conflict over cooperation for something that brings them gain while bringing loss to the rest of humanity.

None of our experiences are disconnected from each other. The suffering of a laborer in a mining operation halfway around the globe brings a tiny internet-connected touchscreen device to another laborer, who uses it to organize another set of laborers constructing a building, which uses materials harvested a quarter of the globe away by another laborer. We are all laborers together, yet with different standards of living and comforts. Some may be physically beaten, while others live under threat of losing their comforts if they fail to continue within the system into which they were born. Others appear to be on top, as rulers of laborers — yet they are at the same time enslaved to those they aspire to control.

All of these experiences are worthy. All are human. All are manifestations of the universe. Who among you cannot experience compassion for other parts of our their own body?

We all exist — we search for meaning in our existence. Many are told what this meaning is through various competing religions. Others find no hope in religion at all, finding existence to be devoid of meaning or meaning to be emergent rather than prescribed.

Are you a good or bad person? Moral or immoral, hardworking or lazy, exploiter or exploited — you are a representation and reflection of the Universe. You did not come from nowhere. Your wholeness as a human could not be if it was outside the boundaries of the Universe. Your sickness, healthfulness, sanity, mental illness, selfishness, narcissism, empathy, pain, love, striving, peacefulness — these are aspects of the Universe around you, reflected within you. None of it needs lead to shame (yet, some inevitably will, as nothing that we experience is outside the realm of what the Universe reflects in us…so burden yourself with no shame from your shamefulness!).

Regardless of how you view yourself currently, you are an experiment of and an expression of the Universe. You are not a mistake, nor are you alone. Your value is inherent within you. Don’t get trapped by what you are instructed to be. Pursue yourself — but do so unselfishly.
