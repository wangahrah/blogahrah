Not like that.

We [the people] like to make things funny ourselves. We say mtn.  You're supposed to say Mountain.  Don't dumb things down. We'll do that ourselves.

It's not funny for a corporation to rickroll me.  Frankly, I just don't like being marketed to. The only effective marketing that earns my respect is a clear and plain presentation of facts, which allows me to draw my own conclusions about the superiority of your product.

I could care less that the "DROID does".   I do care about it's OS, CPU, GPU, 3G/Wifi, and screen resolution.

Please note, in spite of this post, I'm in favor of mountain dew becoming the official drink of being alive.
