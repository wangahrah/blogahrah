Generative AI represents a commodification of knowledge — not a commodification of skill. Skilled developers can use AI to rapidly develop new code (even fully tested code — it doesn’t have to be slop!).

The skills you learn from actually developing working products is the key to harnessing the power of language models while you code — and, love it or hate it, it’s a skill developers (and really, humans looking to survive in the new economy) must embrace.

That doesn’t mean executives who don’t know what ML, AI, or LLMs really are will make good decisions — this is truly a tumultuous time for knowledge workers. Generative AI has massive capabilities to create efficiency, but the old guard doesn’t seem to “get it”.

What is it that we are automating, as engineers, for knowledge workers (including ourselves?) Do we want to automated our human-contact, really? To automate emails and spreadsheets and reports that no one ever read — now generated by AI, read and dissected by AI, with strategy developed based on these communications by AI? I think we’re heading in the wrong direction.

Like it or not though, it’s happening. It’s our turn now — we automated agriculture. We automated factories. We’re automating intelligence now. We still need real, skilled humans to operate agriculture and factory automation, and we’ll need the same for knowledge workers.

When the dust settles, I think we’re going to see something similar to what happened in other industries — far fewer knowledge workers. That’s going to be a long, dark, difficult time for many, while a relative few will reap all the financial benefits.

On one hand — isn’t automation what we’ve always wanted? We want to be able to eat in abundance and provide for everyone. We want all the stuff we want, those material things — factories have allowed massive amount of products to be created with relatively minimal labor. We could be free to spend more time living, and less time working.

And now, we can get the “knowledge work” done with far fewer people. Our automation of food and production allowed us to develop the necessary knowledge-based infrastructure to develop generative AI.

The downside? Our whole economic system isn’t set up for this. We’ve got everything we need now — we can automate the food we eat, the stuff we buy, and have made knowledge a commodity that can be accessible to everyone. Is 80% of the world going to starve because our newest tech development, which should help everyone, is in conflict with economic systems that demand a 5 day work week for everyone — yet is unable to provide that?

I hope we can keep these thoughts in mind as we technologically progress — but if we look at history, we usually seem to make the grim choice. The answers are easy — we need to rethink our economic and political systems in light of who we are and what technology has enabled. The implementation of that answer seems almost impossible.
