I did not raise my children with Christianity whatsoever. On purpose.

It’s not that I have no faith in the wisdom of the Bible — rather, I have no faith in the institution of Christianity.

A wisdom that I do believe in is that we should have faith like a child — and perhaps, in a most un-child-like way, engage in philosophical conversations about what that means. The understanding of what-it-means comes through the journey of exploring what it means — and you cannot understand what it means unless you have explored it yourself. The answer cannot be given to you, only learned.

It can also be shared through our experiences. My journey and your journey are different — sometimes very different — but parts of them will be shared, and the act of sharing helps us grow our collective understanding of what these divine nuggets of wisdom mean.

I did not raise my kids with Christianity — I shared with them Christian stories. I shared with them Muslim stories, Buddhist stories, Hindu stories. These are people — this is some of their expression of culture and spirituality. People believe different things — very different things — and live different ways. Very different ways.

For some reason, it makes us fight a lot, and my kids seem to recognize that is Bad, and sort of against the whole concept of being a healthy human civilization.

So to believe in faith like a child — means I need to do my best to see what my kids see, and to have faith in what they have faith in.

They’ve told me that Christianity, what the fundamentalist Christianity I grew up in — sounds really sus. And they’re old enough to have their own run ins now, and form their own opinions, because I haven’t pushed much at all in terms of spirituality or beliefs on them.

They’ve told me the teachings of Jesus sounds really great!

Their innate sense of what is probably closest related to morality very much lines up with what I used to call the law written on our hearts.
