In order to ease your troubled mind on the subject of good vs evil, I've added some pages (links are on the top of the right column with my current theme) which conveniently list things that are good or evil.  This list is preliminary and by NO means yet comprehensive.  It may take me several weeks to exhaust all possibilities, giving you an important reason to continually visit my blog.

Really, it's a huge gimmick. Can't you tell? Stop being so blind to my ways. Wise up a bit.

A few months ago, it used to be very important for me to get enough sleep.  Lack of sleep led to a day of terrible depression.  That's way different now...I've been very happy, and very content, and somehow I've not gotten enough sleep in a few weeks.  Busy busy schedules.

Actually, I took a break from writing this post, and now I have no idea what my point was.  Penguins are pretty awesome/intense.
