So I read (present tense) the couples' away messages, and it's always
"such and such is the BEST BF/GF ever!!"  And I sit, and I
ponder.  And then I laugh, cause I know, I'm terrible at being a
boyfriend.  Which explains why...

....the rumors of me having a girlfriend were true; the rumors of me no
longer having a girlfriend are also true.  Really, no need for
pity messages or sad thoughts...I think in one way or another, we both
(me and Felicia) both agree and know its by far the healthiest thing at
this point.  So it's not particularly negative, and will be highly
positive.  There's as little drama as possible...we're friends,
and we think each other are super awesome.  All other things
considered though, I'm a horrible boyfriend, which Felicia probably
will agree with.  I'm mean, I'm insanely good looking and I
usually have my head on straight, but my brain is just, nutso.
So, for my next point....

...which is to to clarify: I am not afraid of commitment.  It
seems this is what girls like to accuse boys who break up with
girlfriends of.  Really, I'm a big fan of commitment; but all in
things in their proper time and place, in healthy manners.
w00t.  It just seemed like an appropriate w00t time.

Really, this has been to stem the questions I've been getting and
confirm what needs to be confirmed and deny what needs to be denied.

Now, some of you may need a laugh at the end of the summer.  Here ya go!!
