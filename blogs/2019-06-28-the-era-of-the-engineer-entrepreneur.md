*My desk on any given day*

T**his is for the engineer, the maker, the tinkerer** — though there are many who are capable of pursuing an entrepreneurial path, this is for you. Today, we will all be called engineers, working to implement solutions to real problems and pain points that everyday people face in their everyday lives, communities, and hobbies. There are an infinite number of technical problems to solve, and you are the ones who will be called upon to engineer.

M**any engineers love their job, but don’t seem to have the drive to be an entrepreneur.** I hope to convince you, fellow engineer, to pursue that path, and tell you how you are uniquely qualified and capable you are — and assure you it does not need to be particularly scary and is more worthwhile than it may seem. I’ve been down a few paths — entrepreneuring on the side while working a full time job, quitting jobs to focus on *the thing*, searching for VC, bootstrapping, burning through my own savings, seeking advice and mentors— and have found that overthinking and overseeking have been unhelpful. For the average engineer, there’s a simple, relatively easy path to getting started — it just requires the ability to engineer.

Traditionally, we know that though we’re building *the thing*, ultimately, other folks will reap the lion’s share of profit. Perhaps engineers are less financially driven — perhaps this is a good thing. Money has never given me the kind of pleasure that I’ve received from good design. I’ve never gotten into a beautiful flow state from thinking of the cash in my pocket — but I have been distracted by it, knocking me out of my flow. That same joy in design can lead to a lucrative idea and product — pursuing happiness does not make you happy, and oftentimes pursuing profit fails to make you wealthy (and almost always fails to fulfill you as a human).

I've spent enough time on the Dark Side, with *non-engineers* (I’m just teasing, not all of you are so bad), to understand something of the necessity of those roles — but if you allow me a brief moment of prophecy, I see the times, they are a-changing. We are increasingly able to skip, for a time, the **business** part of things, and just build the thing we need to build. If you don’t want to live in the dirty world of money and business, you won’t need to. You’ll have the joy of creating something wonderful for yourself and the community that you are involved in, and if it’s truly good and worthwhile, attracting more business and scaling will be orders of magnitudes easier. Good things have a tendency to have a far wider range of applications than originally intended. That rapid growth curve may happen a bit later, but it seems to be much more sustainable.

Y**ou are the one who has *both *the ability to see a need and build a solution** **yourself **— and if you need some extra help, I bet you know another engineer or three who can supplement your skills. This is an incredible combination. Sometimes it seems finding the need is harder for engineers than coming up with solutions.

The secret to finding these needs (and really, it’s no secret) is to have hobbies and connect to the communities surrounding them. Grow yourself, learn new things, get involved— the problems that need to be solved will reveal themselves. You’ll have the ability to work on problems that you **care about**. This leads to better solutions. Solutions to problems that are focused on making money may make money, but something always seems lost. Care about the people above profits.

For me, it was [chickens and egg incubation](https://medium.com/swlh/a-startup-for-chickens-24d4affe245d), which led to [poultry splints](https://blog.hatchtrack.com/product/duckfeet/) after trying to help a local friend’s duckling deal with a bum foot. For you, it may be garden management, fingernail painting, mounted archery, or smart monitoring for your mold garden. Too many are seeking to solve the big problems (and really, what truly big problems do we have?), and not enough are focused on the real problems and pain points of smaller communities that they themselves participate in. We should allow and enhance people’s ability to focus on their shared experiences of being human through doing the things they love. The Internet allows these communities to connect, and if you work to solve your own problems, you will have worked to solve their problems. Who better to solve the problem than someone involved in that domain, who wants to build something that they themselves want to use?

I bet you don’t care about what I do — egg incubation and backyard poultry — but you recognize that a lot of people do. I bet I don’t understand much about the cool product you’re developing for your community — but a massive amount of people, connected online in communities, *do* care. You might not hit a $100MM valuation and get VC right now — but is that really something you should be focused on? If your thing is good, and you’re connected in your community, you’ll know who to reach out to — and you’ll find an increasing number of groups reaching out to *you*. I feel like I knew I made it (trust me, I have absolutely not yet **made it **and likely never will, cause that’s not a thing) when unsolicited consultants started to reach out to me.

I’m actively encouraging you to not worry about building the next tech giant or Uber-sized disruptor. Ignore the 1%. Don’t be a unicorn. You don’t need to sacrifice your life. (Alternatively, if you do want to be a unicorn, grab that unicorn by its corn and have it! It can be a different sort of excitement.) You may find success (someone’s got to), but the chances are more similar to winning a lottery or being struck by lightening. It’s a long road, populated with smoke and mirrors, and a big sign saying **Here be Theranos**.

*3D Print your Thing*

---

L**ive your life and expand your hobbies and communities.** Besides being the humanizing touch that will fight the disconnected malaise of today, it gives you a chance to find the problems and pain points in the **things you love** — or rather, allow the problems a chance to find you. The deeper you dig into anything, the more questions needing answers you will find. Do what you love — engineer a solution. *Make it fun*. Build a prototype. Don’t quit your day job. You’ll likely need a little bit of cash— but on the order of a few hundred or thousand dollars. You’ve been saving money for years, right? If not, start now. Skip the next cell phone or car upgrade, and you’ll be able to have hardware built. There’s electronics assembly and 3D printing services, backends-as-a-service, a thousand $5/month platforms to help you manage your projects, lists, everything you need — and huge numbers of skilled people available to fill in the skills you lack, available on a number of platforms.

Use your newly developed innovative invention yourself. If you’re involved in the community that needs it, recruiting users isn’t so hard. You already know who they are and that they want a solution to this problem. Just provide them the solution. Be generous. They’ll likely reach out to you with other problems that need to be solved.

You are an engineer. You can build things yourself. You don’t need money up front. You don’t have to sell any third party on a market or a business plan. You don’t have to worry about recruiting a technical team while having no idea if you’re hiring the *right* technical team. If you get it wrong, there’s few consequences and many benefits. You’ve wasted nothing — rather, you’ve learned quite a lot. It’s trite, and everyone is sick of hearing it, but you learn a lot more from your failure than from your success.

If **you’re a maker, a product-first approach is the best way to entrepreneur**. If you solve a problem within your communities, doing the things you enjoy, there’s no bad outcomes. The worst case scenario is you’ll end up with an awesome thing you built to use while doing something you love. What’s the harm in that?
