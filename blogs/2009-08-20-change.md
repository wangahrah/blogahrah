I'm halfway considering throwing my resume up on teh interwebs, and seeing where the wind takes me.  By the wind, I mean God. But wind is more poetic. And like most engineers, I'm very poetical.

Strange that this top-secret place where I post my thoughts and feelings...I can't post, because I have too many feelings.  I can't even anonymously post the strain and pain my brain has been feeling.  Weird.  The other secret is that I have a top secret google docs page where I keep all my top secret writings.  So only me, God, and the GOOGLE SERVER ADMINISTRATORS can read those.
