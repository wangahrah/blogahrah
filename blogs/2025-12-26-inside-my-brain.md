The observer exists and listens. The observer exists conciously when I am concious of it, and ceases to exist, yet the function remains.

I see a clear geometric shape, yet this place is not visual for my observer. Perhaps he failed to evolve proper eyes. Perhaps he is cursed for his past karma. Perhaps this is just how my neurons are wired.

I observe the shape. Later, I will be able draw it after thining about it, but in this place, the shape is less important than the concept the shape represents. It’s a sort of inner circle, with some kind of bisection line cutting it in two, and there is movement. A line, a concentric circle begins from the center and moves outward, ever expanding. That’s what I was here to see and learn.

I know I must meditate as a bowl of soup. This idea of soup was observed, and I understood and knew my place was to serve. My observer needs my mind to be a bowl of soup. Perhaps my observer is best served by listening and attending. I visualize a bowl of soup, as I must, but this is not a visual space. I turn my mind into the idea of a bowl of soup, the energy of the bowl of soup. It’s the abstract of the soup that matters. It is an honor a priviledge and a skill to be able to observe the observer so directly, and you gotta do what you gotta do.

All the ingredients run together in the soup, and are continously breaking down and running together more and more. I must dissolve the barriers of my soup brain, and allow geopolitics and religion and linguistics and taking care of chickens and washing my hair all run together. All the ideas, the abstractions, the truths of how the universe works, contained in and represented by everything, all turned to soup in my brain and stirred up a bit. There’s obviously no bowl of soup. It’s that concept of soup, abstracted, that is important.

And then the observer looks at the soup through the lens of the object, that expanding concentric circle over a bisection. I do not know if the observer understands and knows, or how much of a part of me the observer is and how much of a part of the universe the observer is, and I worry, have I gone slightly mad?

But the meaning became clear — our spiritual prerogative as a creature with a fairly well developed prefrontal cortex is to expand empathy. This empathy expansion, while ideally existing without bounds, cannot exist without bounds, because that is not the way of things. Our empathy shares something in common with our axis of self protection. Over-empathy threatens self protection. We do have a subcious (and sometimes concious) fear of total enmeshment/emotional annihilation, and we set strong boundaries to protect ourselves against those who would hurt us, physically and psychologically. So the journey of expanding empathy must be coupled with, and can only healthfully expand, alongside one’s ability to draw healthy boundaries with the Outside, and be able to surpass the barriers to empthay expansion provide by the other. As the concentric circle expands, little circles will be found within, boundaries around the grains of sand and boulders presented by the Outside, some of which are poisonous and must be completely encircled with a Boundary to avoid poisining the interior of the expansion of empathy.

correlary: we can see inside ourself, measure the quantitative, but cannot get a grip on the ‘outside’ qualitative without empathy, and if we grow just based on the external measurables we’d….be in America right now. so we need empathy to serve as the invisible guide, and allow the external factors to govern themselves.
