It’s hard for me to put a finger on why I’m writing this. Maybe it’s a chance to stare deeply into my navel and see what it has to say about the economy. I don’t believe anything I have to say is actionable. Just a gentle dissection of what we have, and musing on what could be.

So, the economy. What’s it about? We can argue it’s working as intended — funneling money from the bottom to the top. From the people who don’t have money to the people who already have money. We’ve gotten a little jaded with that reality — this is no surprise to anyone.

That’s not really what the economy is supposed to do. It’s supposed to support and better the standard of living of the citizens living within that economy. It’s not doing though, so it should be changed. It won’t be changed though, because the folks responsible for changing it are the ones who get to control it and shape the policies.

This is my pixel-perfect rendering of our economy. It’s not the only economy, but it’s ours.

*You understand, right?*

In short — the triangle is the Population. It’s bigger at the bottom because there’s more people there at low income levels, and smaller at the top, smaller and smaller, until we reach Jeff Bezos.

The wealth distribution is inverted. The “wealth” is big at the top where the 10%, the 1%, the .01%, the .001%, and so on. They’ve got insanely disproportionate measures of wealth compared to the bottom — more than any time in human history.

The middle blue line — that standard of living — it’s heading in the wrong direction. Things are getting worse for more and more people. Not better. They struggle to pay mortgage, bills, put food on the table, pay for childcare — in a system that now typically demands a two-income household to survive.

An easy observation that this is the same distribution of people and wealth that we’d find in a pyramid scheme — super cool. I’d like to note though, that this is certainly not a pyramid scheme, because pyramid schemes are illegal, so we wouldn’t be doing anything that’s illegal. If we were, we would just make it legal, and the problem is now solved.

We’ve got people at the top, and people at the bottom. Since we’ve started forming these messy civilizations, shortly after learning how to farm, we’ve seen an increased stratification of society. I’ve created a short, inconclusive, and mostly unhelpful list of some professions held, very roughly, from the bottom of human/financial pyramid up to the top.

At the bottom, we see as expected those who make the least and whose jobs seem to hold the least real respect in modern society — the laborers and service workers. We move up to more skilled trades and blue collar work, up through white collar workers and engineers.

I need to admit my personal biases here — as an engineer, I think I’m towards the top of the pyramid of **people who actually do something objectively useful for society**. Doctors, engineers, and I’ll even include scientists are dependent on society to function, but do something that creates real, tangible value to the community.

Above that, we get financiers, lawyers, CEOs — these folk’s value is deeply dependent on the **society they live in** to perceive them as valuable. Lawyers require the rules that we **made up** to have a career. CEO’s are dependent on our business laws, politics, and economic structure to function. They’re steering the ship — but they’re not actually tangibly **producing** anything for society. Same goes for politicians. I’m not saying they have no value — we do, in fact, have a society that is dependent on these things, and though I’d love to see complete reform, I’m not a fan of the utter collapse of society, due to all that pain and suffering it’ll bring to many.

Yet these folks at the tippy top of the wealth pyramid, who do the least to create tangible, objective-style wealth and value, get all the money.

What gives?

Here’s what gives.

*Even easier to understand*

Our economy is basically a scam, and functions as a legal pyramid scheme. One of our economy’s biggest positive indicators, so we’re told, is the GDP — basically, how much money is flowing through it. Whether that money is “real” or not is open for debate.

Where the wealth — real, tangible, objective wealth — comes from is the bottom.

It comes from The People. The huddled masses, who came to America to see Lady Liberty and build a new life — also, those of us centuries past that who are struggling to survive. They do work. They buy or rent places to live. They purchase food, goods, and need healthcare too. How can there be so much money, and so many people struggling to get by?

Here’s a general gist of how it works, why there is SO much money, and how it happens.

You work hard. You put $1 in your bank account.The bank takes that $1, and because of the **rules we made up**, gives a loan of $10 somewhere else. Suddenly, there’s $11 in the economy. One of those dollars is really — the other dollars we conjured up, legally. Not only that, the bank will make recurring interest — they may end up making $20 off of that one dollar + interest!

There’s a valid reason for all this — but there’s also a valid reason that interest-bearing loans were forbidden for most of human history.

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush though — the bank wants that money now, so it bundles those loans together. Instead of making $20 over their lifetime, the bank sells its loans for $8/each, and some other company buys the right to get that interest over time.

Then some folks who were quite smart in the brains but quite small in their hearts realized that the economy swings up and down. What if we could place some bets on those groups of loans — we can bet the value will go down, or that it’ll go up, and either way, we’ll make more made-up money from that. And what if we could influence politics and media in a way that lets us **know in advance** what’s likely to happen, and then make our bets accordingly? This is where it goes completely off the rails. Through an overtly and purposefully complex system of financial laws, making it all legal, we end up with a perverse system of made-up money, where through each level of legal scam, the $1 of real-money gets multiplied and multiplied, until suddenly **the economy** gets fueled with $7,500 cash! It’s all still **anchored** in that $1 — so it’s fine.

Remember, you only put in $1 though, so you can only get $1 of it. The rest of the $7,499 that we made, we’re going to keep. You’re still on the hook for all your loans though, even though we’ve grown fabulously wealthy off of you.

Oh, you’re suffering? We’ll be happy to give you a stimulus check if you need it once in awhile though, especially considering that we’re going to make bank off of all of **that** imaginary money that you thought were getting to. It’s going to flow up through corporations and private equity, since you’re going to need to spend it all. It’s all just going to go back to us, and then we can make even **more money** off of that money you thought you were getting.

I’ve realized now that my initial graphic was wrong. The brown shape of population density vs wealth is wrong — let’s look at the blue line.

It’s not even a pyramid — the vase majority of people are way towards the bottom, and the vast majority of wealth is way near the top. Even cooler. Worse than we could imagine.

Our system is cooked. Toast. Doesn’t work, and never will work for society’s benefit without drastic change. Nothing we can do about it though, except keep participating — I’ve got a burning desire to eat every day.

---

Remember, all that money is made up. When the system collapses, a lot of the wealth collapses too, and even though we made it up — we **treat it as real,** therefore, it functionally is real. People lose their jobs, their homes, their ability to provide to their family. It’s not a neutral system that lets some folks get extra-wealthy while funneling those benefits down to those who are providing the stable foundation of the economy. It’s an **actively predatory** system that extracts from the bottom, moves it to the top, and currently is pushing downward on the standard of living for the vast majority of people. A pyramid scheme, crushing us more and more quickly.

---

I think I’m done on the economy we have now. It’s not doing the job an economy is supposed to do. It’s no longer capable of even keeping employed within itself, much less raise or stabilize a safe and healthy standard of living. That’s clear and obvious, and anyone in power who doesn’t acknowledge it is not truly working for the benefit of society. It doesn’t matter what your ideology is — the facts are clear. We’ve never been a species that seems to care much about the facts though.

Luckily for you all, I do know what it should look like.

We’ve proven we can create fabulous wealth out of nothing. We can use that fabulous wealth to keep everyone at a healthy standard of living — a standard where they have food, housing, clothing, education, healthcare.

Who’s gonna pay for it? The same people who are paying for it now. Them. The wealth that’s parasitically sucked out from them could be used, after run through our made-up-money-multiplier system, to support them. The people are the ones generating all the real work, and the real wealth. If we want a society, we must demand nothing less than a society that, first, funnels its resources into making sure everyone is cared for, full stop.

Or, we could ditch the system we have, and rethink our economy and society from first principles. People have certain needs — food and shelter being a priority. Through our incredible developments in science and technology, we could easily turn our collective energies to addressing those problems first, without the need for our complex and predatory economy.

The shape of wealth vs population doesn’t particularly matter if everyone is above the blue standard of living line. There will always be the have-mores and have-lesses, but there is no longer a reason to have the haves and the have-nots. Let’s let all have what they need, since we could easily do it.

After that — once everyone has the basics — it’s all fun and games. Want to be the wealthiest person in the world? Go for it! Build your business, roll up the corporate ramp. Innovate with new products, services, digital platforms to make the world a little bit easier and a little bit more full and joyful. Just play by the rules— no stealing from people, no dragging society down to lift yourself up. Beyond that — do awesome things. Pursue your dreams. Do no harm.
