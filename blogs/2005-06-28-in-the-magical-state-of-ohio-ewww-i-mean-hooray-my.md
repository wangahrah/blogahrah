In the magical state of Ohio. Ewww.  I mean, hooray. My imaginary
girlfriend still has to work even when I'm here visiting.  Then
we're going to the supahmarket to get super cool food.  Neither of
us cooks, so it's peanut butter and jelly.

We went up to the 'ville Sunday night to visit some people.  It's deathly quiet compared to normal.

Felicia had a brilliant observation.  As we were walking hand in
hand around Cedar-Lake (ahhhhh nooooo), we passed by the recently
erected monuments to Cedar-Art.  You know, those things they put
up by the clock in front of the SSC...it goes through the days of
creation.  The art for the 6th day has a picture of God's lips
breathing onto Adam and Eve's faces.  Good work Cedarville on an
attempt to bring some art in, but FeFe informed me that, maybe that's
not exactly how it happened.  I checked just to be sure, because
I'm not familiar with such things, and Eve was made a little bit later,
from Adam's rib, not poof breath of God into both of them and bam
people are made.

Ah well.  No pictures make me sad.

But the new Xanga option of selecting what game you're currently playing is schweet.
