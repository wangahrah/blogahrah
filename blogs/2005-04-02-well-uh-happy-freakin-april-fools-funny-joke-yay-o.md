Well uh, happy freakin april fools.  Funny joke, yay!  Oh
well.  I haven't gotten to bed til 4am or later all this week,
sometimes til 5:30, so I'm pretty beat.  But it's 3:30 now, why am
I still up?  The answer to that is clear from a few posts
back.

I have good news!  Leah Jones and I are now pretty much
dating.  You see, she promised me some Jone's Potato Chips, which
are world reknowned for their epic flavor as well as their
aphrodisiacal qualities.  I made it quite clear to her that if I
didn't get some, the consequences would be dire.  Her diabolical
roomate finished them off, leaving me no choice but to force her to
date me.  Here's a picture of us on our first date on a scenic
nameless island somewhere far away from everyone else.

Pretty much we're just going to gorge ourselves on potato chips, until we end up looking like that Palmer boy Ben.
