The left and right are at war. They are each consuming the other. At the same time, they are wholly dependent on each other for survival.

The Ouroboros is an important symbol for these times — the snake eating its own tail.

The Auryn is a variation of this — a double snake, one dark, one light, each consuming the other.

The left and the right are the dark and the light. It doesn’t matter which is which, as it constantly changes and your labels will soon become meaningless. They stand in opposition to each other, yet even as they devour the other, they begin to become the substance of what they devour. Is it inevitable — to become the monster we consume in attempt to end it? Is what we are devouring truly monstrous, or does it just seem that way from our perspective?

Republican, Democrat — they have consumed each other before. The parties have changed views and stances in their struggle for power. The American snake should serve the people as it consumes itself — what influence can we have over the snake, and what influence does it have over us?

In theory, America has the ability to control the form of the snake. Rival ideologies will always compete and devour each other.

If we have Republicans and Democrats, and we continue to allow these snakes to feed off of each other, we should not be surprised that the cycle never ends. It seems Americans are ready to change the form of their snakes. Will we actually seize that power?

A warning — be wary of the single snake. Without a struggle of opposing forces, the force in power grows fat and oppressive on its own filth.

If someone wants to make a donkey — elephant version of the Auryn, please let me know.
