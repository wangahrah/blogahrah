My initial reaction was frustration and anger.  I quickly realized that was useless, and, ultimately, incorrect.  Why isn't my initial reaction to smile at the glory and beauty of nature and be comfortable relaxing for a few minutes watching a wonderful scene?

There were probably about 50 geese altogether.  They decided to walk across the road at that time in that place.  There are some things in nature and life you just can't control.  I need focus on not just accepting that, but fully embracing it to see the beauty and peace of not being in control.
