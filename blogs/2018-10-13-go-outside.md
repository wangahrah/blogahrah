Humans are built for the natural world. If you take any creature out of its natural environment, it can survive (and at times even thrive), but there’s a certain amount stress that comes with not being in your natural habitat.

Though built for the natural world, we have domesticated ourselves, just like wolves did. Easy food is the key to this — our work has become abstracted from our survival. We (at least modern first-worlders) don’t farm the food, build our own house, or carry our water from a nearby stream. We work jobs (which are increasingly useless to society), get paid (usually direct deposited directly to our bank accounts), and that is used to provide for our survival. I don’t think our mental wiring has yet evolved to find fulfillment from that as we find fulfillment from working hard to grow food ourselves. Electronic currency transferred behind the scenes is extremely convenient, but does not allow people to connect this abstract form of value to the real value of fulfilling our human needs. (Many people are horrific at dealing with money anyway — when it’s even further digitally abstracted, it gets worse!) People now are able to sit inside all day, then spend leisure time playing Fortnite or Minecraft or whatever those damned kids are playing these days. At least they’re not on my lawn.

Most humans, left out in nature, would fair a bit less well than our domesticated puppy dogs.

Our self-domestication has allowed us to achieve incredible things and build giant cities — beehives of humans with complex interactions, economies, cultures, all humming together (and sometimes falling apart dramatically). Not needing to spend incredible amounts of time and energy to simply eat has freed us to pursue larger cooperative goals. This isn’t a critique of progress or technology (perhaps that comes later!). Our cities (and suburbs…don’t get me started on that) have disconnected us from our evolution.

I don’t believe our minds are coping with this well. Our mental health crisis is multifaceted, but our lack of understanding of ourselves as evolved biological organisms is exacerbating the issues. Perhaps if we spend some time thinking about how we evolved, we can continue to progress in a more mentally healthful way.

I have never met a person who didn’t feel a deep sense of elation at the beauty of nature. Perhaps it’s a beautiful butterfly or an incredible sunset. Maybe it’s the pitter patter of rain, the morning fog cloaking something in the distance (probably a Sasquatch), or the dew on a woolly mammoth caterpillar when we head out in the morning to feed our chickens.

Go outside. You were built for it. Find the quiet place in nature. If you’re in a city and you can’t, find a way to be quiet in your own mind at a park. Maybe you could try hiding in the bushes alone?

Just go somewhere outside. Anywhere. I prefer places that are unkempt and wild. Stare at the weeds and flowers. Stare at the sky. Stare at the bugs (that’s one of my favorites — check out [Tiny Town](https://manfang.smugmug.com/TinyTown/)!).

Don’t try to solve any problems. Don’t even worry about your problems. Don’t bring your phone — or at least, shut it off. We were not built to be able to handle constant distractions. You’re not solving problems. You’re not helping society. You are simply existing. Be mindful of that existence.

Outside. Just do it.
