Oh man.

We’ve done it again.

Put our foot in our mouth. Bit the hand that feeds us. Thrown a stone at a glass house. Led a horse to water, but couldn’t make him gather moss. Threw a boomerang at a bird in the bush, and it came back and hit us in the face.

Not too long ago, there weren’t too many humans. Here’s a dramatic AI-generated graph of human (and some ancestors) population growth over time, starting 2 million years ago:

*Until recently, there were approximately 0 humans (rounding down)*

Again, with rounding, nearly every single person who has ever lived was born yesterday — which really explains quite a bit.

We figured out agriculture, and, boom, we were off to the races with being able keep more humans alive. We could grow things, raise livestock — feed people! Quite a novel concept at the time. It’s just gotten worse and worse since then though.

Really, it hasn’t, I’m just feeling generically cranky. It’s gotten **way** better for the average human, even considering the gross human injustices we face in modern times. We haven’t quite taken the time in the past 12,000 years (roughly the start of agriculture…it has **not been that long**) to take a step back and introspect as a species, and perhaps now would be a lovely time to do so. There’s a good chance we’re already too late, but on the off chance we’ll make it through, let’s try and get some perspective — and remember, creatures and critters and plans and life evolves cooperatively with their environments. That’s how they survive long-term.

Don’t think that we’ve got it figured out. I don’t care who you are or what you believe (and that goes double for myself) — we haven’t even begun to figure it out. We’re a blip on even the human timescale, so it naturally, intuitively — obviously, may I say? is clear that we haven’t evolved for **this**. When I say “this”, I am indeed wildly gesturing around me in all directions.

***

There didn’t used to be much **this**, really. There were a few things — like eating, mating, shelter, and those things were very much more difficult early on. We’ve solved a lot of that through technology — agriculture being a primary development that launched humanity’s population growth.

After these technologies developed, we started having a lot more to worry about, and those problems started to become more based in interacting with society — interacting with a group beyond yourself and your immediate family/tribe. You needed to get along well enough with your neighbor, because you grew the wheat, and they raised the pigs. Those social interactions began to have significant impact on a humans ability to have their base needs met. They didn’t have to do it alone anymore, and could reap the benefits of sharing a diversity of a work with a village, but I imagine you had to be a bit less of an asshole than you did before this whole community nonsense got started.

Yet it remains true — greater community led to better ability to meet basic needs, therefore a greater ability to specialize.

Our population skyrocketing, our ability to increasingly meet basic needs, our increasing specializations leading to unfathomable increases in knowledge and technology, all leading to greater integration and an increase in size of our community, our bubble, our civilization. We’ve a global civilization now, whether we like it or not. Pull up your phone, and I guarantee you can find a perspective that someone genuinely and empathetically holds that you find **absolutely repugnant**. We are very closely connected to each other, and we’ve got a whole lot of disagreements.

We’re fighting now, after only a few thousand years of this. It’s about capitalism and communism and commerce and individual liberties and socialism. Inescapably — or perhaps explicably, our fights and our solutions are framed based on the current on-the-way-to-globalised society, with the problems we have and the solutions we have devised to try and engineer this society together. We’re trying to figure it out while it’s feels like it’s going down in flames. Nobody even brought duct tape.

Back to basics though — we constructed this stuff. Really recently. And it’d be a poor act of self-love to not give ourselves permission to acknowledge that the reasons and ways we fucked things up really may have seemed to make a lot of sense with where we were at the time, and the next “at the time” was upon them before the previous time had it at all figured out.

Let’s take some time and try and figure out how to integrate what-we-know-now with who-we-evolved-to-be.

***

These lighthearted musings come with a deep sadness, because it could be different tomorrow, with nothing standing in our way but ourselves. It’s always been that way though — there’s an endless past to future string of tomorrows — and we’ve never managed to get ourself off of this ride, hurtling closer to the destruction of our planets ability to sustain us, while simultaneously oppressing 99.9% of ourselves at the same time.

So really, what I think we should seems the opposite of radical to me. What we’re doing now seems radical.

***

I think we should dismantle the governments. All of them. Simultaneously. strategically.

People need to have their basic needs met — everything after that is icing on the cake. The initial step is ensuring every gets to eat. Rather than an immediate removal of government, we instead, all nations at least feigning democracy, elect those officials who immediately enact systems to feed the world. We have the technology to grow food almost anywhere in a sustainable fashion, and the people of the world who currently are not should begin gardening, homesteading, chicken keeping, and small-scale farming, for the expressed purposes of serving their immediate community. As the bounty grows, the radius of overlapping food producers can feed the world — with the resources of the global community growing to support the people of the world. We’ve got agriculture, and it enslaved us to the modern system of food. We can simply take it back and produce food ourselves. Or are we simply too lazy and complacent? If so, I have little hope — that’s an active choice to remain a slave, and none will be able to save you.

Now, of course, dear reader, you question me — the agriculture revolution allowed for the explosive and sustainable growth of the human population. Why on earth would we want to feed people?

Well, the end of the story is that the more successful, happy, and taken care of a population is, the lower the birth rate is — and it tends to fall to levels that will gradual decrease the population of humans, which is something that we truly need. Historically, wars and plague and famine self-correct overpopulations, but human ingenuity has begun to stymie this — but the system still appears to self-correct, as high developed societies simply have fewer babies. So feed the people — all of them.

With a network of self-feeding communities, empowered by the technology given to us by knowledge, we will have each other, rely on each other, and begin to be free from the shackles of the governments we have (ostensibly) chosen for ourselves, but still seem to try and enslave us. When you create food with other humans in a community, there’s a spark that’s created. I think it’s a spark from those 2 million years of evolution that proto-humans came from, where we, together, had to find a way to make food happen. It’s primal. Food together grows community together.

As we are feeding people, we can begin to dissolve back to a time before — but a time still so recent. The closer we can get back to who we were, who we evolved to be before this uncontrollable surge in population and technology, catapulting us from a tiny tribe into a global community, the better, most likely. We’ll be able to rediscover who we were as people, outside the constructs of the artificially created yet real-to-us societies we live in, and then be able to remake empowered choices for ourselves.

We will have the knowledge of modern man, and regain the soul we lost, and begin to rebuild and reframe what society even means.

We move back to city states of some form, perhaps villages and hamlets. It’s your community — are a city, ranchers living far apart on acreage? Do you want to choose a suburb? Fine. Elect governors, mayors, kings. Be a democracy, republic, benevolent monarchy. Choose what you need for your particularly community and your particular problems. Let’s acknowledge we did a lot, real fast, and roll back maybe a few thousand years and start again.

I’m an engineer. It’s pretty established as best practice (though rarely followed) that it’s best to build your prototype, craft your experiment, run it and play with it. After that, toss out the prototype and start fresh with what you know — you’ll probably not toss everything out, but you can re-engineer what you’d like you with a wealth of new knowledge and experience that you simply couldn’t have had before.

This is, truly, an engineering problem — an application of knowledge to a practical solution, with a solution (or better yet — a bunch of solutions) that serve as an answer, an aide, a guide, and a set of tools that help answer the ongoing question of “What is this society thing anyway?”.

I’d imagine the next step may look something like building modern appliances — dishwashers, clothes washers, dryers, refrigerators — that last a long time and work very efficiently, quite different than the manufactured-to-fail system we have now that effectively drives an economy, along with effectively helping make us broke and annoyed and wasting the resources this earth has so graciously made available.

So look. I’m not really offering the grandest plan, because how can you plan for what will organically grow? How can you plan what the people will do? I suggest simply feeding people and rolling back government in a way that would create independent, local municipalities, that could choose to grow and connect and team up and trade and form nations, or abolish nations altogether and adopt a more indigenous model.

Remove the ability of the corporations and governments to control you by removing the the reliance of the people on them — which we are quite capable of doing. So, why aren’t we?

This does, honestly and truly, seem like an absolutely irrefutable, uncontroversial take. We made it all up, we moved too fast, we made many mistakes — let’s toss out the bad parts of the prototype, and try again. I bet we’d do better the second time around, and when we end up here again — I hope we’ll try for a third time.
