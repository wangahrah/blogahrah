She was wearing a hoodie that said “We Are All Human”. He was an evangelical Christian.

For better or worse, there was a discussion about the Israeli-Hamas war. The details and stances, in this case, aren’t important — this isn’t about a discussion of geopolitics, the war, potential genocide, or the protection of anyone’s homeland.

At the end, I said it’s important to remember that everyone is a human, thinking about the hoodie, intending to make a statement about the inherent respect and compassion that we should have for each other, so often lost in propaganda, war, and divisive media rhetoric. Left vs Right, Palestinian vs Israeli, different religions, cultures, ways of life and thinking — we jump quickly to dehumanize “the other”, sometimes accidentally, and I believe if we didn’t make that jump, things might be a little better.

“It’s important to remember that everyone is a human.” He gave a look with a slight eye roll, and said he knows, and **that’s** part of the problem. I inquired a bit more deeply, and what he meant was — coming from an evangelical Christian perspective — is that humans are bad. We have a sinful nature and aren’t capable of being good without God.

I imagine, if the discussion took a turn to focus on semantics, understanding how we were using the term **human, **we’d end up in agreement that people are all human — after all, alongside a belief of the evil nature of humans, evangelicals also believe we are all created in God’s image and are worthy of respect. I don’t think (at least in this case), there was a real disagreement, but it revealed a deep rift in meaning, and gap in a primary understanding of what a term means, and how to interact with that in a discussion.

### Semantic Inversion

It’s fascinating that a word or phrase can take on opposing meanings depending on context. Amelia Bedelia, in beloved children’s books, struggles with this frequently — she needs to dust the furniture, so she sprinkles the furniture with dust. Does **dust** mean to add dust, or to clean dust off? Our government can sanction additional funding to an important program. Conversely, it can implement punitive sanctions against an enemy in war. There can exist both positive and negative, opposite connotations and meanings, to the same word.

The term **semantic inversion **can help us understand this phenomenon and the difficulty it can create in conversation. Two parties may end up talking past each other, with their words meaning different things. My intent in saying “we are all humans”, which is meant to point out the positive value and relationships we should hold with all people can be lost when the same phrase takes “being human” in a different direction — interestingly, in this case, the negative take can also be an accurate one.

Regarding the more negative take regarding “being human” — while I don’t believe we inherently possess a sinful nature or need God, I do believe in accepting the primal, protective, and even violent aspects of our humanity. I can acknowledge the reality that a group of people might resort to intense violence to protect themselves from an enemy, whether real, perceived, or somewhere in between, as a genuine facet of being human. Yet, I still desiring to convey a message that we don’t lose the positive aspects of our humanity.

### Oh, Semantics

Trivializing the meaning of words is common when a person feels the core message that is being conveyed is being lost by harping on the exact definition or meaning of a term. Often, this is true — at least, in the sense that the meaning can be lost. A partner may say, “You never listen to me!”, creating a scenario where the other partner focuses on the word “never”, instead of hearing the core message of a partner feeling unseen and unheard. In this circumstance, two things may be true — “never” is semantically inappropriate, an error on the speaker’s part, resulting in an error on the listener’s part where they may become unnecessarily focused on the term “never”, and lose the bigger picture of the message that is being conveyed.

Frequently, these sorts of arguments will devolve into a discussion of the word “never”. While true that this is inappropriate for this scenario, it’s more important for meaning of the conversation to be addressed, rather than exact terms. I hope, dear reader, you’re capable of admitting that the “never” you said is wrong, and can come to terms with needing to change how you address that issue. I also hope, other dear reader, you’re capable of admitting that you’re focusing on semantics, when you should be focused on addressing a human, fallible in language and with inherent emotions and the difficulties in communication that befall us all.

However, there are times when semantics are core to the discussion, and cannot be dismissed without losing the core message. We can return again to the discussion of “human”. When we engage with matters like war and human rights, it’s important to remember the positive aspects of humanity when we are trying to encourage each other to have empathy and compassion — to not dehumanize each other. We can’t disregard the differing meanings others may hold, and when we detect a misunderstanding or disagreement on something we think should be taken for granted, and respectful “What do you mean by that?” or “Here is what I mean by that” can make all the difference for successfully communicating your core message.

As an aside — this isn’t to say the more negative, fallible take on “being human” should be disregarded as uncompassionate. When your family member gets angry with you and speaks in a way they shouldn’t, it’s incredibly humanizing to allow them to “be human”, and when met with an apology, to acknowledge this with saying something like “I understand — I’m human too”. We’re capable of good and bad, right and wrong, and many shades of gray in between.

### Cultural Semantics

As we’re engaging with semantics, I suppose I need to engage with what I mean by “cultural”. I’m using a very loose definition that may be different for all individuals, encompassing their regional, religious, political, family, and personal-life-experience culture. All of the special sauce that’s gone in to making them the version of them they currently are, and the lens that they use to see the world.

While we might make an argument that we should try and achieve a more prescriptive or pragmatic approach to language, we have a dazzling variety of ways of seeing and experiencing the world. I understand this as an amazing and beautiful tapestry of what “being human” means — it means we see the world in different ways, and use and interpret words in different ways. With this acceptance, I hope we can gain a less ego-driven approach to communication with our other fellow humans, and begin learning to practice listening and communicating through our own perspective, while retaining utmost respect for others, and not dehumanize them for having a perspective colored by their life experiences which are different from our own.

### Media Dehumanization

As we close, after what I hope is a useful exercise in humanizing each other and understanding how semantics can play in to that, I want to engage with what perhaps is the most destructive force tearing apart our ability to humanize each other — the media.

The power of words and meanings is on full display in the media. Framing stories to serve a singular narrative, clickbait headlines, and the drive for engagement resulting in advertising dollars has a profound impact on public perception and our collective reality. People have been divided into demographics, served the language of their choosing, resulting in polarization and distorting our ability to communicate with each other. Both sides will call the other criminals, radicals, and thugs (among many other things), without engaging in a narrative about what those words mean, or what the opposing side stands from — energy is not focused on humanizing connections and communication. These names remove the humanity from real people interacting with the real world for reasons that are very real to them.

Consider the issue of borders — do you support border security, or open borders? This binary framing reduces the issue to two extreme positions, without exploring the meaning of the issue, and dehumanizing the humans with needs to pass through the borders. A sense of division is fostered, rather than a constructive dialogue about the reality of the world we live in. Secure borders doesn’t imply we need to dehumanize those who cross them. Open borders does not mean free crossing — it can mean a focus on humanitarian concerns or economic benefits. This semantic reductionism results in harm, for humans fed these words and narratives and to those who need help.

Are you pro-life, or pro-choice? Do any humans claim to be anti-life? (Well, certainly some, but so few as to be a non-issue in this discussion). We remove the ability to have a constructive dialog with parties forcibly divided by the media into two camps with two labels, both focused on the negatives of the other side and the positives of their own side. There is no space given for constructive, humanizing discussion — and indeed, the language we use to frame these issues hinders this very discussion from happening.

Are you a socialist? Are you a capitalist? Is socialism government-owned business and institutions, or worker-owned collectives? Is capitalism the complete control of wealthy individuals and corporations over our economy, or does it discuss the role of private enterprise in the economy? Media and politics again uses words to divide people into separate groups, being fed separate narratives, and doesn’t try to meaningfully interact with real economic issues and their implications. Rather, they use language to divide and grow in power themselves, harming both our culture and the humans within it.

### We Are All Human

For good and bad, better and worse, and mostly, all the in between spaces — we are humans. It’s incumbent on every individual in their daily interactions to learn and practice respectful, healthy communication with others, with an understanding of the different ways in which we view the world and how our use of language can differ. I hope we can focus on grace in our communication, and attempt to understand what we may initially feel is wrong, rather than talk past each other and lose the meaning and beauty of the perspective of other individuals.

I hope as well that the majority can begin to see through the narratives pushed, particularly from the top down in media, are unhealthy. They starve us of the beauty and complexity of meaning and understanding that, when pulled together, create a beautiful tapestry of human existence and experience. We are all human.
