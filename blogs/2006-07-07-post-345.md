Pay no attention to the ninja in the background.

We sailed around on the pirate ship, flying our flags and yelling generally pirate-y things.  Then some landlubber callin hisself a "reporter" decided to take our names and photographs for some sort of "paper" scurvy dogs in these parts read.  A fine dinner of meat and rum followed by encounters with beautiful wenches of all sorts...twas a fine night to be a pirate.
