As she rages and walks away, and tells me just how much she’s changed, and the awful things that I have done to her, and that this isn’t the right time, and if I just wouldn’t say anything, things would be fine, and that she feels like a pebble in my shoe and everything she does is wrong, and she’s tried to change so much, and I have made her feel so small and so awful and it’s always been about me and for me, and my 3 year old son tugs my hand and asks for a snack as she tells me about me and my demands and how terrible and small I’ve made her feel, but that now she knows she’s OK, she says with energy, anger, and hostility (or perhaps my emotional radar is so off, and she’s feeling \*\*none \*\*of those things), because she’s looked inside herself, and knows she is beautiful and worthwhile, and everyone else thinks she is wonderful and it’s just me, and I am just controlling her and manipulating her, and my son tugs my hand, and I remember the times I have yelled at her with tiny ears around and know I am not without sin, and I do now try and keep my mouth shut so this can end and I can get my son a snack, and internally I bleed, as I suspect she is bleeding.

I know I have yelled at her, and hurt her, and there is no getting around the pain I have caused her, and if she finds it to be abuse, I understand, and I have, I think, more often than not addressed what she said head-on, and dealt with my anger (I rarely “lose it” anymore”), or my “aggressive” postures (I keep my distance), or my “violent” tones (I purposeful err on the side of keeping my voice quiet). A combination of therapy to help me understand **the feelings** and introspection and personal spiritual practice help me to realize the darkness in me and how to be able to better and more healthfully interact with people. But, I’ve been an asshole before. Am I now? She tells me she has changed so much, done so much, and it’s never good enough for me. I tell her I am only asking her for one thing — when I tell her “You hurt me”, to feel like a human, and not have it suddenly become a giant clusterfuck of anger and emotions where I am awful — all because I say, hey, you did this, said this, and it hurt me. She has said “What kind of man are you?”, and scoffed at my sensitivity. I don’t know what kind of man I am, and I certainly can be sensitive. I hurt and I resent from a decade of having to be, as it relates to our relationship, A \*\*Man \*\*who cannot be hurt or have feelings about our relationship, while still shouldering the responsibility of her feelings.

I go to my room and I shake, and I’ve learned to let my body shake to release the tension like animals do. My brain is mush, I am hurting, I feel thrashed and dismissed again, unheard when I feel pain. I believe she feels the same way. I am concerned that no one has awareness of what they are doing. I am more concerned if she does have awareness.

I shake and want to cry, but I can’t cry. I cry all the time. I don’t know why I can’t now. She is a trauma-life-coach, and tells women to roar their rage, and pain and hurt, and to not be silent, and to speak out against the men abusing them — yet I sit here unable to cry, with scant few interested in listening, and know I need to find another therapist.

I had, I believed, at least I tried, to calmly and gently and quietly bring up something that had hurt me, and explained the \*why \*around it. It’s not that she shouldn’t have asked me that question, in what sounded like a neutral-negative-strange way?…but I’m not supposed to tone police, so what she said was, “Is there a reason that you didn’t wash my bowl?”.

Feelings immediately flooded me, and the question seemed designed to do that, but maybe that’s just me being — as she has told me before — too sensitive. No I said, that’s not it. It’s my bowl, it was from upstairs — I’d left a bowl with some rice, and the rice hardened, and I let the bowl soak to clean later. I wasn’t sure why she would ask that? I had done the dishes and cleaned the sink. I’m not looking for a Dad of the Year medal. It’s part of the chores of the house. I had just come downstairs from laying with my oldest daughter to help her fall asleep, which can be its own stressful thing. I felt like I came down and was greeted with a weird question that definitely made me feel. So I said no, it was my bowl. And that was it, or it could have been it. She is right about that — if I had just kept my mouth shut, none of this would have happened.

I started walking away after answering her, and I felt feelings and tension and resentment building. We have lived in separate rooms for about a year now, with not a single night spent together. I’ve had no hope for awhile, and this is part of why. I remembered when she had told me angrily that she would NOT do my dishes, that I was responsible for them, and I didn’t fight. I said angry things too, including “I don’t want you to cook for me anymore”, because I’m a petulant child when I’m angry and upset. A number of times — between 2 and 5 — she has directly told me to **do my own dishes**, and seemed to go out of her way to not do the dish that I left on the side of the sink. That is, hurtful in a strange way that I don’t know how to describe, perhaps because of her history of talking about how her service is her love, and I see her love-in-action as being mostly gone, despite the words that are used. And I know, I made a personal choice to do her dishes, even to clean her pots and pans when she makes something for herself and not for me. It’s something a good roomate does — when there are dishes, you can clean them. I know she doesn’t necessarily feel the same way. I am on permanent dishwasher duty, it seems, and it’s never been talked about or discussed. When I did gently bring it up…something like “Hey, can we talk about the dishwasher situation? It feels like one day you just STOPPED, and it’s 100% me now, and I want to talk about it”. She responded with “No, I’m happy with the situation as it is”. No discussion, no talk. I continue to do the dishwasher. It’s not a big deal, it’s 10 minutes maybe, and if it keeps things peaceful, fine. I continue to often do dishes, and know she often does dishes, and it’s not about the dishes. It’s not about the dishes at all.

So I go back. I tell her — I’m feeling some things. I’m calm, and I describe to her the feelings and resentment and why, and that it also hurts that it feels like I can’t ask the question she did — I can’t imagine the fallout if I ever asked her “Is there a reason you didn’t wash my bowl?”, and she has **directly told me** do your own dishes, and then asks me **is there a reason you didn’t wash my bowl**, when I know I have made the choice to wash her bowl….but I’ve already talked about that.

She is upset. I’m attacking her or accusing her. She asks what \*\*SHE \*\*is supposed to do then, not ask questions and let resentment build? What’s she supposed to do with her resentment? I said….**this**. We can do this, we can talk like this. We can talk about it gently and calmly and bring it up.

And she tells me — you could have just said nothing. This did not have to be a thing. I just asked a question, and you could have just answered it and walked away.

My heart sinks, or freezes, I don’t have the energy to find the right metaphor. I feel that again I’m told — Michael, you have a feeling about us? You have anything on a negative-emotional-spectrum to say? Keep your fucking mouth shut. She’s never said those words, but it feels like that. Keep the peace, be strong, don’t be so sensitive. When you are sensitive or do anything that makes me feel bad, I will get **angry**, I will insult you, I will emasculate you. I will tell you how hard I’ve worked to change, that I have bent my life to be perfect for you, and it’s never enough for you. What kind of man are you?

Jokes on everyone, I have very little to emasculate. I just want the pattern to be — Hey, this hurt me. Oh, oh man. I don’t want to hurt you, or anyone. I’m gonna incorporate what you said into my life because I want things to **function and be healthy**.

As my heart freezes, I hear myself say it out loud to her. This pattern is **emotional abuse**. I see her emotions rising and fire in her eyes. How dare I say that after everything that I have put her through. How dare **everything** make me upset with her, and make her feel so small, and it’s really **my** fault. I am attacking her, and threatening her (though I can’t see how!). She has a long history of being abused, but I suppose not terribly much in the last decade, except for what she tells me I have done to her. She is the abused one. I have yelled at her and hurt her (and I have!) How could I say anything like that about her? She will turn the conversation to every bad thing I have ever done, and the latest is to say how controlling and manipulative I am of her behavior — how I try and always have tried to force her into changing for me. I have trouble parsing this — technically yes, I do want her to change hurtful patterns, but I do not view this as me trying to control her. She views it as me trying to control her and her behavior. She said because I like puzzles, I am a manipulator, and she likes to dance with life, not view life as a puzzle, so she is not a manipulator.

I make my voice quieter, and I lower myself to my knees. I am trying to be as non-threatening, as clear, as vulnerable as possible. I remember how she has angrily told me that I am angry, that I am an angry person (I don’t feel like an angry person, but I did have issues with anger blasting in the past), that my voice and posture is aggressive, that I instill fear in her, and I want to actively **not do that!** I tell her that I am not saying she is the worst thing, and does she remember last night? She had told me she thinks I’m a decent man, and I am just blind to the patterns of my family in me, the negative ways that I am like my father and my family, whose very presence gives her PTSD, and she will share her insight into that if I request. I tell her — I am not saying you are consciously abusing me, or that you may even be unaware of it, just as I, and everyone else, is so blind to much of our Self. But that the **pattern** of continued, decade-long minimization of another person who you claim to love’s feelings, the complete shut down of ability to talk about what is hurting them — is emotionally abusive. I remember so many occasions of bringing a speech pattern or behavior that hurts me — at one point it was, **please stop being so mean**. And I was just being sensitive, and I used to LAUGH when she was mean and I should just do that again (and god knows, she IS funny), but it got old and started to be hurtful, but I am too sensitive.

I am talking quietly, I am not feeling rage, I am trying to communicate. She looks at me with **horror** in her eyes, as if I am a monster. She tells me I am being **creepy**. That why am I saying this, and how can I be talking like this? She tells me I have to leave now, that she is not ok, and this is a boundary she needs to enforce.

I am confused, but I walk away. I was being clear and calm, I thought. I was being everything she has always asked me to — except for silent. I am not blaming her for my feelings — I am expressing my feelings as they relate to this situation, and the hurt that I have around them. I tried to be clear it is the pattern of forcing me to suppress all of my feelings and never bring them up that is emotional abuse, not her saying “Why didn’t you wash my bowl?” But I also know that if one of her friends told her that her husband said that, she would go on the war trail about abusive men.

As I pass through the kitchen, I tell her that I want her to know, that I am confused, and I am not sure what I did wrong, but I know I am being dismissed, but I do not understand how I was being “creepy” or what that means. She does not explain, and I am still confused.

I am OK because I have seen this pattern so many times that I have become, either numb or understanding, but I still cannot help but worry that I am a monster. A vicious, cruel human, so blind to his own horror that he would take it all out on the person closest to him. I know that part of that may be true — but I also know, in any relationship, if you cannot say “you hurt me”, without it blowing up and suddenly becoming the monster for everything you have ever done, and have no ability to talk about a specific situation, and them playing the role of the saint (or victim?), for always trying so hard, that there is something also wrong that is **Not Just Me**.

please help. we need help. men need help. not really much help, just a little bit of a listening ear and to feel human, and then we will move mountains. we are not monsters, no more than women are monsters. we are all

just

people
