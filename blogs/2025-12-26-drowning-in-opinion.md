I am overwhelmed by external narratives.

I have a strong sense of self, but self requires the Other as a backdrop to understand oneself in relation to the Rest.

When the backdrop rapidly changes, the perspective of the Other on one’s Self also changes rapidly, though the Self feels itself to be static.

Every influencer, narrator, talking head, figurehead, mouthpiece, and individual with a sense of Self tied deeply to society — particularly social media — speaks predominantly in absolutes, in certainties.

Those who are thoughtful and open minded, interested in the perspective of the Other, no longer is tethered the old, obsolete (no, it’s not obsolete) pattern of speaking to individuals one on one, small groups interested in each other’s humanity, sharing views, perhaps controversial, in a safe space where we a safe to be unsafe. We hear everything, unless we take steps to quiet it down. What were once tools for connection and interaction with humans are now a seething, roiling, tumultuous, overwhelming cesspool of fear of missing out on an opportunity for self embellishment.

Those who we most listen to and see on a daily basis have a **following**, and there is no greater trap than your own followers.

Eschew the followers, and follow the Self. Respect the followers. Respect the Other. Strive to understand.

Seek quiet. You are missing out on nothing. Let them be lost.
