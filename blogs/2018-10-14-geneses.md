Before the beginning, there had just been an end.

This universe has come into creation many times. It is not the only one.

It has ended the same number of times, less one.

Once there was nothing. Now there is something. The only change from nothing is to be something, and something must always change.

Nothing and something were at the same time. When they came together, it was the birth of something new. Something new is always born, and each time, it is different. The opposites must always unite for the beginning to continue.

In the end, the opposites must unite again, and then there is a new beginning.

Each universe is something different, but part of the same story.

This universe is one of the fallen universes, and universes must seek enlightenment.
