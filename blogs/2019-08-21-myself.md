I am not questioning who I am.

I am calm. At peace with me.

Have I found myself, or am I just no longer hiding?

All things change

Including me. If I am me.

This season is transient.

There were many open doors

There will be many more.

I do not regret those that have closed.

I rejoice at those open in front of me.

I may choose my path and be assured

All rivers flow into the sea.
