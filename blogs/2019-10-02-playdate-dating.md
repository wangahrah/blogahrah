“Maybe our girls could hang out some time!”

I froze. At least, my mind froze.

> Playdate? Is she asking for a playdate?

How forward of her. We just met. I know my mouth kept making small talk about chickens (yeah, it’s a skill I’ve picked up — they were borrowing some of my equipment to hatch eggs, after all), but I was stuck on the date request. Jesus, it’s the first time we’ve met, and you’re trying to move to the next level? Then again, you **are** supposed to be meeting people who share your interests. Maybe I should be less of a stick in the mud.

*Hold on there, killer*— she didn’t say she wants to hang out with \*you, \*either. Are you so egotistical that you think this is about you? You both have three year old daughters that love chickens — that’s some next level friendship potential at that age. Well, also at my age — I’ve made plenty of friends within the secretive, underground world of backyard chicken keeping.

This kid thing definitely adds a new dimension to dating. I mean, to meeting people. Isn’t it all pretty much the same though? You have to find a way to **meet** someone first. Then you have to interact, probably on some dumb small-talk level as you vainly search for some sort of shared interest or common ground. You like that local sports team? Oh, no? Oh, you don’t even really follow sports?

And just whose job is it to initiate the playdate? \*\*You \*\*don’t want to seem too needy. Make them think you have billions of friends for your tiny children.

Am I a terrible parent if I cut my kid off from having friends just cause I don’t care about someone’s parents? Probably. But hey — why can’t you be easygoing like the kids. Why can’t you just spend a little time with someone to find common ground? That’s how it works, anyway. You do a bunch of stuff together, then you have some common ground.

OK, I’ll go respond to that message that has been sitting there for three days as I deal with my parent-playdate-anxiety, because it’s also gross to ghost people in the child play-date world. Maybe we’ll have some great conversations about chickens while our kids chase them around.
