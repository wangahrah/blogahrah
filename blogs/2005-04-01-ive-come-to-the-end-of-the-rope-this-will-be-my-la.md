I've come to the end of the rope.  This will be my last semester
here; then I'll be gone.  Are chaplains allowed to leave after
their term is served?  I'm just sick of Cedarville, can't really
take it anymore.  Most of you know I have never really 'liked'
Cedarville..and I definetly still don't.  I am NOT attempting to
make any sort of judgement call on Cedarville itself, nor its
rules.  I'm not saying their wrong, or bad.  They're just not
ME, at all. Does that make sense?  I'm a terrible dancer, but hey,
it's a brilliant stress relief.  Oftentimes I feel pulled to go to
places we're "not allowed" to go, in order to touch people's
lives.  I ain't a bad kid.  My parents back home, as opposed
to my parents other places, I suppose, don't give me any rules.
They say that I've earned their trust, and that even involves them
trusting me to be the man they have trained me to be in situations they
KNOW will not good; they let me do those things.  Rules are fine
and good, at times.  The tendency in the Bible seems to show,
however, that spiritual discernment, not rules, are the  mark of
maturity.  I've been raised by amazing, godly parents, and they've
trained me to seek God above all else.  I don't want Cedarville to
throw in a lot of extraneous laws of man that will harm my thinking
about God.  Therefore, I must leave.  There's plenty of other
little things too...Cedarville is just so NOT me, the theology is
different, the denomination, I don't buy it...etc. etc.  But
sometimes, there comes a time to follow God's leading elsewhere, and I
beleive He's showing me that Cedarville is NOT me, and calling me
elsewhere.  This is not just an angry "I hate you all I'm leaving"
sort of thing.

But, I love you all, and I will miss you dearly.  And this xanga will stick around, eh?  Sweet.

And to keep things lighthearted, here's a picture of someone I went to high school with.  Actually, just their foot.
