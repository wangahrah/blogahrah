today i found myself laying down, sobbing on my office floor, with my wife cradling my head as i desperately asked her what was wrong with me, why i was losing it, why i felt so crazy.

“postpartum”, she said.

the story is likely longer than that, peppered with recent marital fights that took a toll on both of our souls.

postpartum depression. it’s something i went through with the birth of my first daughter.

it’s something i’m currently going through after the birth of my second daughter.

i love both my daughters. i love my wife. i love where i live. i love my job/jobs (me and work are in an “it’s complicated” relationship). my life is really about as close to picture perfect as it gets. and usually i’m pretty in touch with that.

there’s no reason for me to be depressed, and i almost never feel this way, so for it to happen again immediately after the birth of one of my kids suggest it’s really a postpartum thing.

i work from home and see my daughters and wife all the time, which i love. even if it’s sometimes harder to focus on work, i’d rather err on the side of my family. an interesting side effect of this which i can’t quite prove without some expensive testing, but seems to be totally realistic, is that i’m much more in sync with natural rhythms of biological processes. i believe the closer you are to someone — emotionally, spiritually, physically — the more metaphysically linked you become. biologically, it also seems clear hormones that hit one partner are also going to have a chemical effect on the other partner.

i dont like the term postpartum depression. it seems a wildly innacurate term for what i feel is happening. it’s more like a temporary hormonal imbalance. it can hit women like a ton of bricks, and it can hit a surprising amount of men as well.

there’s many reasons this can hit men. maybe it’s hormonal. maybe it’s lack of sleep. maybe it’s because your wife suddenly seems to give less of a shit about you, but sometimes you forget she’s got a baby that needs her full time, and you’re a grown ass man who can take care of himself a little more than usual for awhile. for me, it’s actually not lack of sleep. at almost 2 months, she’s slept through the night, every single night. this is where i brag about how good my kid sleeps, even though i have nothing to do with it. but for me, i do believe it is primarily hormonal.

that’s where the story ends, for now, and likely there’s not going to be much more to report except possible a bit more of the same. because, it’s temporary. hormones balance out. babies grow up. life changes and always is in flux.

take depression seriously, but also take it with a grain of salt.

as i look back and read this, pretending like maybe i’ll find some grammatical error and fix it, it makes me seem thoughtful and evolved. you wouldn’t have known that when you heard me fighting with my wife. i don’t believe depression, mental illness, or even just having a bad day is a reason to treat your partner terribly, and i’m sorry.

the biggest takeaway was that when talking about the hormonal component of this, while clutching my head, crying, and trying to understand who i was and what was going on with my body — the confusion, pain, roller coaster emotions — my wife said “this is basically daily life for a teenage girl”.
