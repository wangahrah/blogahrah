How shall we solve this problem, this eternal conflict? The self vs the other. The group like us and the group not-like us.

It requires a philosophy that can unite the two. A way of thinking that values the individual. A way of living that holds the needs of the other — the enemy— with reverence.

We live in a time that preaches the primacy of the needs of the individual, so much so that we begin to confuse wants with needs and opinion with facts. We value ourselves so much that we self-sabotage and begin hurting ourselves with how badly we hurt those around us.

What if our worldview teaches that ourselves and others are the same? We are all children of God. We are all manifestations of the universe. Maybe this is some giant space alien’s brain, and we’re just neurons trying to figure out how to control it.

When we function well together, we do much better individually. When we value ourselves **and** others, because we are all reflections of each other, we can thrive.

If we are all the same, part of the same consciousness, our goal must be to recognize that and cooperate.

What if part of the consciousness is self sabotaging? Is our responsibility to find the **cancer** growing in our organism and root it out?

Doesn’t that turn us into every other religion? We’re creating a matrix of good and evil with cosmic scorecards and heaven and hell, or maybe the chance to come back again as another creature, though possibly the truth is that we may just ascend and leave behind this existence.

Once something is labeled as a **cancer** and **enemy**, Pandora’s box opens. You’ve created zealots you don’t agree with, dead set on protecting the thing in a way that violates the spirit of the thing. Nevertheless, things must be protected. Some people were born for the fight. Other people were born to fight those people — though really, those fighting have more in common with each other than they do which side they are on. The other is truly the self.

But that is a message for a time of war. We must be ready to set down the swords as readily as we pick them up. As soon as possible and as soon as wise, sue for peace with the other, for they are your self.

Live together. Garden together. Play sportsball and drink wine and celebrate all of the celebrations. When we have each other, it’s harder for our other to divide us. Even when we are fully united, there is still an Other, and the cycle will always continue.
