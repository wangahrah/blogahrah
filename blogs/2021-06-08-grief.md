### The grief is fresh. It washes over me in waves. I’ve already tried to distract myself, but can’t — and shouldn’t. The cycles of grief are cyclical, and move between sheer pain and a nostalgic laughter. When it’s fresh, it happens faster and swings higher.

I feel completely silent. Almost unable to speak. There is so much in my mind. There is so much I have experienced. A year has passed where nothing has happened (all while so much happened — what gives?). A day has passed that contained years.

I didn’t know when I woke up. I knew it was today, but I didn’t know what would happen. I couldn’t know. I just knew I was ready for whatever today was.

Two weeks ago or so, Meghan had called calmly — with a very suspicious calm for a known panick-er — that something had fallen out of Paddy’s sheath (yes, the sheath for that thing — welcome to farm life), and he was bleeding, and she thinks we should call the vet. Blood from that area seemed a legit reason to call the vet.

Cancer, pretty fast moving, nothing you can do or could have done. With the vet industry [trigger warning — anti-capitalist content] being so money focused (not that we don’t trust our vet, we definitely do), I expect to be sold a cure for a thing that’s not really a big problem. I didn’t expect something serious — it was probably a scab falling off. I wasn’t expecting this.

Now the time is ticking, and we need to say goodbye to Paddy. He’s always been a cranky pony. He’s bit Meg’s face — she can show you the scar. He’s bit my chest. Holy shit, do horse bites hurt. He was just worried we were gonna steal his food though, so honestly could you blame him?

I knew I was sort of adjacent to Paddy’s life. We weren’t best buds, but I loved him. I’m not really Mr. Horse Guy, more supportive husband of a horse gal. I respect horses as, I don’t know. Powerful emotional intelligent living creatures, worthy of the respect you give to people. I hate plenty of people, though I respect them as humans. I don’t hate horses nearly as much as people, but it doesn’t mean I want to spend all my time with *them* either.

Paddy was special. When Star died several years ago, when he saw the vet poke him and saw Star fall… Paddy was lost it — out of his mind. He’d been through some clearly bad times in his life. Times I will never know, never can know, and likely aren’t great, ending with him being sold for slaughter. Meg got on a horse rescue thing — and I get it. There’s an industry of abuse and slavery, and also a lot of good people who love horses. He’s seen some shit, and he doesn’t trust people. If Star is getting the death poke, when am I getting it? I must be next.

I went into his stall, and didn’t bother to try and touch him. I told him, I **promised **him, I would never do this to him. There weren’t random killings. You weren’t slaughtered just because you were a pain in the ass who bit the hand, face, and torso that fed you. This place didn’t work like that.

After Star, the herd leader, died of kidney failure, the first thing Paddy did was take over his stall — the biggest and baddest of all the stalls. Paddy has never been the leader of the herd — he almost seemed to exist outside the power dynamic. He was just Paddy, and to the outside observer that often looked like **cranky**.

There was a little baby bird in the barn today. It was slightly obnoxious, and totally unafraid of us. Its mother flew around, calling towards us unpleasantly, but not seeming to be filled with much fear, either — mostly annoyance. The barn was a safe place.

I said few words to him in the last few weeks. He was easier to approach, but didn’t seem interested in really hanging out. That was ok. If he didn’t want to deal with my bullshit, he didn’t have to. There was a group of people that were closer to him than I was.

I heard Meg’s stories, and stories of people who worked with him in the Wildish Way program. I knew Paddy, of all the crankster ponies, had made a significant difference in the lives of human beings. What a wild legacy for a pony to have — traumatized pony turned therapy pony.

Paddy was the first horse I rode. Well, not totally true — I went on some beach horseback ride thing on my honeymoon, but when it comes to “real” riding a horse that’s like, **your **horse, Paddy was my first, and he was not gentle.

I mounted Paddy, but forgot my helmet. Meg handed up the helmet. Paddy panicked at the sight of Meg lifting up the helmet and bolted. I fell off. I’m sure it was very graceful.

This ends my horseback riding experience on our horse farm.

His job wasn’t to be a riding pony. He and Aery came together from a feed lot, about to be sent out for slaughter. Aery was a very young horse, maybe a year old, and sticking to Paddy, this cranky pony, as the only source of stability in her short, panic-filled life, right after being separated from her mother with a bum leg. He was all she had left, and had clearly adopted the role of a protector. They had no idea if they’d come to a better place or worse place. When they first arrived, they had a bad case of strangles.

He was oozing goo out of so many orifices. It sounds terrible. It was. He got cleaned and wounds flushed several times a day, for — however long it took. I can’t even remember. It’s exhausting to treat a horse multiple times a day who refuses to be caught and treated.

I watched so many horse training videos. How do you teach a horse to trust? How do you teach a horse that you are alpha, so it just listens? Is this alpha theory bunk? Why do I have to learn some kind of horse psychology to be able to figure this shit out?

We rescued you, chill out, eat some alfalfa, get a little spoiled. What about that don’t you understood?

I think he understood that, but learning to trust after trust has been broken is hard.

I became a better person learning about Paddy. To this day, I don’t know if one of my dumb plans traumatized him even worse. We NEEDED to catch Paddy to put a halter on him. I know he was traumatized and whatever, but there’s also practical needs on a mini farm, and sometimes you have to move pastures, or get vet care, or just be like, you know, some kind of farm horse, not a feral I-hate-everyone horse.

I got it in my head that I needed to just **run him down**. Show him I was in charge. Humans had two legs — horses had four. In an endurance race, a human would win, according to Wikipedia probably. A horse can run so much faster, but in an enclosed space, I could run down a horse to exhaustion, and then with great celebration, I could simply place my looped rope around his neck. No lasso. No theatrics. Man vs Horse in an endurance race. Man had evolved for endurance running, and I was all the glory of Man.

I was note. I forgot that I hadn’t grow up in a tribe that required a lot of endurance training.

I must have been in better shape back then. It was a hot day. I thought I was dying, but I did it. I ran him to exhaustion, and put the halter on him.

He was easier to catch after that.

He didn’t let me talk to him until today. It hurt me a little, but I knew I couldn’t dictate my place in his life.

Today, the day he was going to die, we talked. It was, I hope, all we needed. I’m not going to describe talking to a horse, but I really hope more people can learn how to listen to a horse. They can understand you just fine — you have to learn how to listen to them. If you can’t listen to them, they’re not going to have a lot of respect for you. (You can beat the respect into them, but that’s not very humane of you, is it?)

I take a long pause after I say this. I refill my whiskey. I should go to bed, but I think not-processing your day is a damnable offense.

When a horse falls, a blast of energy emanates. Many people are numb to it. If you are not, you know. The night becomes infused with energy and power. The energy of the death encompasses everything. A powerful soul is released, a body is released, an existence returns to its source, with experiences and love and joy and hate and trauma. This is what we have returned to the source — this life. How have we treated it? Have we cared, loved, improved, respected? Have we abused, mocked, stolen, trampled?

Paddy experienced both extremes, yet the night was infused with positive energy and ideas. I walked around, feeling his presence and feeling so present. Feeling blessed. Feeling the joy of knowing he was no longer shackled to his previous pain. He knew he was loved. I’m so grateful he knew. I’m grateful he could be himself. His life would only have been better if he had a hundred acres to roam free, and approach us only when he chose, to get treats and scratches, and then to vanish back into hiding for weeks. We all can have dreams.

The pain is raw and real. I have pictures. I’m looking through them, remembering him. Watching him closely in the pictures. Trying to feel what he feels. This is not Paddy. Paddy doesn’t stand there and deal with you. He knows. He knows he is loved. He knows he loves.

I had to step away again. I’m back. The waves keep coming. The tears keep coming. I can’t stop them, and I have no desire to try and stop them. They are pure and honest. I am in the present, and this is what it feels like.

I know it was before his time, but time did not care. Paddy never should have died. He should have been a loving pain in my ass for the next 15 years. It was too soon. It was too soon for me, but it was not too soon for time, and I talked to him. I know it was not too soon for him, though he was afraid.

I didn’t used to think that horses knew the day was coming. Now that I’ve seen it, I cannot help but believe they know. But you need to exist with them to understand. Humans can barely have compassion on other humans — I don’t believe it’s going to be any time soon that humans can have compassion and respect for non-humans.

Our babysitter was sick, so I had to, after saying goodbyes, bring the kids back to the house. I wasn’t **right there** — I had to watch from afar. It was ok — we had talked about it. He should be with Meghan — this connection is powerful.

He died with his momma right there for him, loving him and mourning him and celebrating him. We all celebrated him, while he was alive. I hope this helped him be more ready. I think it did.

He died. After he died, I got to walk around the property and be present with him, though he was gone. I noticed everything. I could see again. I could see how the beautiful the flowers were. I could see every blade of grass. All of nature was singing in harmony in honor of Paddy. I could see it. I could hear it. I hope to never be the same again.

I’m too tired to continue.

Paddy died today. I loved him, he is loved, and his legacy lives on. I am honored to have played a role in his life.
