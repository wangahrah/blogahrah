When my kid was first learning to read, she had moments of I describe of abject horror. Dragons are her favorite, and she read….drah-gon. “Dragon? What’s a dragon”?

I was confused, because she loved draongs. I said, “You know, dragons. You love dragons”. She started sobbing and crying and yelling “NOOOOOOO! It’s JRAH-GONs!”

I tried to take a moment and understand what in the world she was feeling, and it turned out to not be that hard. She thought the D-sound was a J-sound, and when I say “jrah-gon” and “dra-gon”, they’re a lot more similar than I would think. Her growing world of knowledge and reading had pointed out a difficult truth to her — she was subtly wrong about the name of her **favorite thing**.

She got over it pretty quick, and when we came across the word “dress”, she just got a cross side-eye look and moved on. She’d realized this would happen plenty, and I find as something of a grown-up myself that I still mispronounce words all the time. Something about reading too much and not actually speaking those words enough catches up to you.

This feeling though — that feeling of the thing you think you know best, that you **really** know — and it turns out you were wrong. Maybe not even totally wrong — but subtly wrong about a core truth of the whole thing.

I know this can lead you to wanting to reject it. It can throw your sense of identity into a loop. It can make you angry about why you choose to believe those things. You realize that jrahgons aren’t even realy in the sense that it would be REALLY COOL if they were real that way. But it’s not. It’s all made up.

Then you give up on jragons and because interested in uggs and crypto and the coffee wars (for the record, I think the coffee wars are a one of the most reasonable wars of all the wars, though not being a coffee drinker myself).

You don’t have to though. You loved jragons because jragons are awesome and you shouldn’t have to turn your back on it because it’s a dragon not a jragon.

What I mean to say is that all religions are one.
