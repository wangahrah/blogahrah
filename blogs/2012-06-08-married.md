Oh hello.  I got married.  Writing here hasn't been much on my mind.

In the coming days, I'm planning on opening up about some personal stuff, that perhaps some religious/spiritual minded people don't usually, or maybe they do and I just don't care, just like you won't care.

I'll plan on talking about the lead-up to getting married, getting married, crying a lot, and cursing out your fiance and telling her you're cancelling the wedding.

I might talk about smashing coffee tables in anger or ripping shirts off in anguish (but not in a sexy way).

Finally, how bitches be crazy, or maybe not.  And how fun/awkward an all inclusive resort can be.

So far it's been fantastic, if I'm allowed to call 2 weeks fantastic.  It's like having a live in chef/maid/sexbot.  Don't worry, I put up shelves and fix broken stuff, so she gets something out of it too.
