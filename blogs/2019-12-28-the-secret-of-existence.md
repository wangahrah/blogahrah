One basic truth. Simple, yet elusive. You may spend your entire life pursuing it, but the more it’s pursued, the faster it slips away.

The deeper we look into the smallest of things, the more things shrink away. When a molecule is torn apart, it reveals atoms. When we fix our eyes on the atom, the universe explodes into a shower of quarks, photons, gluons, with no doubt of ever more fundamental particles and forces lurking just out of sight. We fire giant energy canons at invisible particles just for a chance at finding something smaller. Fields of energy ripple through space time, with matter bobbing out like so much detritus in the water — the essence of things lurks below the surface.

We turn our eyes upward to see the sun and moon. The farther we look out at the celestial bodies, the more the universe expands, pulling away from our observation. Yet, we find ever new and more powerful means of observing. We squint, and planets resolve (and some are rejected — let us not suffer the fate of Pluto). Stars, bright and faint, turn into something in which we can see a pattern — the Milky Way, a galaxy of our very own — or perhaps we are the very own of our galaxy. Smudges, smears and blasts of energy turn into faraway galaxies and nebulae birthing stars. We find clusters and superclusters, each with their own patterns and symmetry, yet all still gloriously demonstrating obedience to some greater force. Stars explode, alerting us of their presence, but we hear it long after the cry was made. They have long been reborn.

Look up, or look down. Look straight in front of you, then turn around and look behind. It looks different, but fundamentally, it’s the same. The more we understand of the tiniest particles and energy fields, the more we understand the completeness of the universe and multiverses and multi-multiverses. The same patterns emerge. The pattern of the atom is the pattern of a solar system. The death of a thing — ashes to ashes, dust to dust. New life emerges from the ashes and dust. Fundamental particles group together to create larger groups of fundamental particles. Atoms and molecules, planets and solar systems, galaxy groups and superclusters. The are the same. They themselves are born and die, then reborn into new selves. They return to their fundamental elements, and are regrouped into new patterns. It may be the death of an atom, man, star, or a galaxy — all beautifully demonstrate the patterns of death in bringing forth something new. That which is birthed obeys the same pattern of that which died to birth it.

Somewhere in these patterns is the secret. It lies right on the surface, and the surface reflects both that which is above and below.

Why must existence do its best to obscure its meaning? Creatures camouflage themselves. Language is filled with deception. When illuminated, darkness has no choice but to hide away. Why is society structured in such a way to blind you to what you are?

Take heart when you find it. Hold no ill will to those who do not. Revel in the joy of existence. Engage in the life you are living. You are not alone.

You are loved.
