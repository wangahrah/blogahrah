I went to CNN.com because of something I'd heard about.  Go there.  Look on the right side.  Are you a Facebook user, like almost everyone else?  You get to see what all your friends were doing and sharing.

I've seen MSNBC reading what people are tweeting about in response to issues.  Now news is "reporting" on what my friends' think is popular.

How bout news?  Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
