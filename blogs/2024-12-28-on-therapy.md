## Therapy is pretty simple.

Find that thing inside yourself. Shine a light on it — recognize it, engage with it as part of yourself, accept it as a way you are. This can be difficult if it’s in an area of the brain deeply impacted by what we call trauma. Perhaps personality traits, family, or culture stand to block it. But really, to heal from something or embetter yourself, it’s deeply about understanding yourself.

Once you find what you’re looking for — once the light is shining — it can begin to dissolve itself. Perhaps more accurately — it can take on a healed form within you. Maybe it’s not something that will ever go away entirely, but you learn the lessons you can from it to become a more fully self aware person.

There’s a lot of different styles of therapy and tools used in them. CBT, DBT, Family Systems, EMDR, exposure — but all these therapies are really tools, different ways we can plumb into our subconscious, where our triggers and traumas and what sums up to be the symptoms of our unhealed selves live.

No silver bullets exist, but there’s a lot of tiny hammers and mallets and pickaxes, and sometimes bulldozers, that can help excavate our soul-mines of the dirt and debris to leave the shining gems glittering in this mine that we apparently now live in.
