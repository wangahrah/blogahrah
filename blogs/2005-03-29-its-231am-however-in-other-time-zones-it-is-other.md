It's 2:31am.  However, in other time zones, it is other
times.  I found out something interesting.  My drug of choice:

![](http://images.quizfarm.com/1102007902smurfs.jpg) You scored as **Mushrooms**.
Shrooms! You're still goin for one of the most natural drugs. You'd
like to visit a whole other world, and see things you've never seen
before. #&#*in trippy.

Mushrooms

100%Ecstacy

69%Cocaine

69%Marijuana

63%None!

50%Inhalents

44%Alcohol

44%

Smurf yeah...I'd say that was
pretty
accurate.  But not talking about just my general appearance,
talking about the drug.  Since I'll probably be baptist before
long, I most
likely never will never try such things.  But its something I'd
really like to do, just
because.  I score really highly on those "Would ya do it for the
experience" or "Would you do it just to do it?" or "Are you an idiot
and can't even pretend you were trying to impress people, you just
thought it'd be interesting to do if no one found out and if you died
no one would know why?"  sort of things. The careful observer will
see apparently that I would not (and this quiz does not lie!) drink or
sniff, I'd rather not do drugs at all!  Oh well.
