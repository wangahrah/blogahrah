I find this video to be deeply moving, in the make my eyes watery sort of way.

People are exactly the same, no matter where they are from.

This shows the average JOESIXPACK, or JOESAKEDRINKER, or JOESTARVINGTODEATHINAFRICA.  People aren't inherently out to get each other.  A few powerful people, with money and motivation to get more money and power, are enough to throw the world into a tizzy.  But really, I think we all want to be able to be silly, enjoy life, and have the funds to travel to different countries and do a silly dance with people.
