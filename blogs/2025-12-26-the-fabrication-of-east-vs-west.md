We’ve been bamboozled. I’ve bamboozled myself. I’ve always fallen in to thinking of East/West like Yin/Yang. Two polarities, different, with incredibly beauty to be found in the synthesis of two equally opposite, equally correct, equally wrong ways of viewing the world.

Even though I’ve found the ideas of East/West fascinating, I’ve never considered them outside of that paradigm. Opposite polarities isn’t always the right metaphor. Some things are parallel, perpendicular, older, newer, dolled up, subsets or supersets of other things. An orange is not yin to the yang of fruit — it’s the manifestation of a superset called fruit.

West is a subset contained in East. East is the mother, giving birth to all things. West is the mirror through which to view a lens of the East, and in time, turn into a parody of itself as the manifestation of the image becomes grotesque and filled with ego.

I’d had this picture of West embracing logic and reason, East embodying intuition and emotion. East does not deny logic and reason. It’s logic, reason, intuition and emotion.

West grew from East, looked at itself in the mirror, and fell in love.

Maybe that’s wrong.

Maybe they are the same. Maybe we’ve drawn a dividing line, as tribal beings — in love with having an in-group out-group dynamic. Perhaps West and East are imaginary, completely fabricated, a story built by ourselves to keep us in a prison of our own making.

Much labelled \*\*western \*\*has a deeply powerful intuition. Many so-called **eastern** holds reason in high regard. Both sides of the fence are just imaginary things dreamed up by humans, who really are far less nuanced than they think.

I think they’re the same. All aspects can be found in both. Some more, some less, but tearing down this wall brick by brick would be a noble goal.
