It was easy to feel there. It was right on the surface. The conflict, the energy, the power, and even the resolution — It was right there to see. There was a façade of ancientness, but that ancientness was really magic. So many places felt so different — power shifts were dramatic and constant, and I imagine it felt like home to you. It was unstable, yet would not overpower you.

The power lurks deeper here. You have to know how to hear it — It does not scream at you and beat you over the head like there. It does not make itself known. Though you seek more, you also need to be more passive, or at least able to listen. The voices are quieter and stiller, but they are here. They are just as powerful, just more set in their ways. It’s not the wild wild west anymore.

It hurts to not hear your source. It doesn’t mean it isn’t there or that you have been abandoned. I do not know your spiritual practice.
