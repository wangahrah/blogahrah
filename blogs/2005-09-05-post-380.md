Expeditions must be made to determine the truth.

What is this abandoned house next to Palmer, behind the Hill?  I
think it's a place that rabid pirates go to eat their babies.  I'm
probably wrong though.  There's a broken window though, so I guess
we can go inside.

The window, when viewed from the inside, is broken.  Just like it was from the outside.  Spectacular.

This is an empty room.  It was pretty exciting.  There wasn't any zombies.

This is another room.  There was stuff on the floor.  There
was also a shrunken human head from the ceiling that wasn't exciting
enough to take a picture of.

Here is the kitchen.  There were cabinets.  There were a lot
of books like "Summoning of the Dead" manuals in there.  There
were also a lot of bones in them, but I didn't feel like taking a
picture of them, either.

In the next room Kerry was attacked again, and whipped out his sweet action weapons and start blasting zombies.

Kerry decided to take a shower to wash off all the blood and guts on him.

We camly strolled out of the house after ridding it of the undead
menace.  But there was a suprise for us.  There was blood
sucking mini zombies all over us.  Here's a picture of some of
them on my leg.  But they were pretty much everwhere.  Turns
out it doesn't really hurt a lot when one bites you, but when there's
about eleventy billion, it itches maddeningly.  I'm going to
shower now.
