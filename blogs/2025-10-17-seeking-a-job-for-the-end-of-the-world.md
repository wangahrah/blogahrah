I really need a job. You see, I enjoy eating, and have a terrible reaction if I stop. I like my wife and kids eating too. It’s great to have a house, and some little niceties too. If I don’t have a job, it’s a real struggle to get any of those things — and if you go too far down that rabbit hole, it gets harder and harder to recover from.

My worries seem almost small though, as I look at the country. I do not live in fear of being ripped from my home or my family. I live a bit out in the woods, and there’s no folks in camo and masks withs guns roaming around with automatic weapons and smoke bombs and pepper spray. I’m not on SNAP or supplement programs, so I’ll be wholly unaffected by the sudden cuts.

My literal entire city hasn’t been razed to the ground. I am not one of the tens of thousands of dead children in Gaza. I am not surrounded by dirty, malnourished bodies. I am not on a flotilla trying to bring aid or awareness to those humans.

My kids are not at risk of being snatched away to join a children’s army led by a warlord. They are not sent into mines for precious metals while we grow sicker and poorer — in fact, it lets me drive an electric car.

I need a job, because I need to pay my bills. The bills that really enrich someone else. The debt that piles up to keep me in a cycle of being drained, or lose it all. I have to fight and strive and survive, with the fruit of my labors going up the chain to the people at the top.

They drain me. I drain the global south. The humans drain the world. When the world is drained, we are done.
