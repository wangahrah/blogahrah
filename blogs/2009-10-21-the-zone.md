I only seem to manage to consistently blog when I'm in a certain mood.  If things are going great, I tend to forget about it. If things are bad, I don't blog anything significant because I don't feel like I want to publicize all my feelings. That's a change from my wistful days of youth; I used to advertise everything.  Now I don't.
But things are not bad now by any means.  I just decided to let you all know that.  And you all is...well, this isn't really a place most people know to read.

I'd like an opportunity to cut my mind free and drift.  It relaxes me.
