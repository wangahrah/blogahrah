*The beauty of chickens with no neck feathers*

I’m seeking authenticity in my writing, and the best way seems to be to just do it. Apologies to anyone who follows my writing early on in the process, as it’s likely to be terrible. My thoughts are all over the place, and I hope to be able to distill them into discrete, understandable chunks — this is for my own benefit. If anyone wants to join the crazy, hop on board. My goal is to do minimal/reasonable editing, and learn to write honestly and clearly. I’m not looking to become a renowned writer, which I realize does take a lot more thought (and editing!).

Another thing I should work on doing is avoiding prefacing every god damn thing I do with some sort of purpose statement/explanation of what framework I’m coming from, and instead jump in.

A too-high percentage of my understanding of people is because of chickens. I was never one who understood the value in **human experiences**, including holidays, social institutions, or even good food. My brain may be wired more like a crazy person than I ever thought, but in a way that is inconspicuous. You’ll have to ask those around me how conspicuous it is — my wife thinks its pretty obvious that I’m a weirdo.

I’ve viewed human institutions as something of a lie for a long time. I did a book report on Squanto in middle school. That’s where I learned instead of being a cool Indian dude who helped out the Pilgrims, it’s really a story of abduction, abuse, and disdain for a culture viewed as barbaric by the western world. Then, we celebrated Thanksgiving. (Sorry Mom — You got the brunt of my anti-holiday sentiment, and I know Thanksgiving is your favorite).

*This is exactly what it was like.*

I wasn’t wrong in my view, but my experience was different than other people who just saw the joy of having friends and family together, and were not concerned with origin story much at all. I can’t say they’re wrong in their social view, nor was I wrong in my view that Thanksgiving is based on something horrific.

Back to chickens. These birds are some cool cats. Really, I like chickens a lot — there are dog people, cat people, horse people, and chicken people too. I spend too much time staring at my chickens (and you’re gonna hear a lot about it over time). I grew up thinking that people were like me — that they exercised the power of their mind, made decisions based on evidence, and given information, would make proper decisions based on that information. I was wrong. Not totally wrong, but probably in the way-wronger-than-I-should-have-been class.

I see fundamental behaviors in chickens (and other animals) that mirror what I see in humans. Most noticeably, I notice chickens don’t spend too much time gazing into their navels, thinking and philosophizing and planning. Note they don’t spend **much **time doing that — I guarantee some of them are much more wily than the average bird (stay tuned for hearing more about Waffles the rooster!). They’re concerned with finding food (especially easy food!), mating (especially easy mating!) and avoiding death (I try to help this be easy for them).

*Waffles, you magnificent beautiful bastard*

I realize humans are a lot more like chickens that I believed growing up. The average person doesn’t spend much time thinking, and more time just living. That’s led me to realize I’m looking to find and connect with more people who actively think. People who don’t just live in their human/chicken tribe, doing the human/chicken thing — people who question the fundamentals of human behavior and explore why we do these things. It doesn’t even mean we need to stop the human behaviors. Quite the opposite — an understanding of what we do and why helps us to enhance those behaviors to be our best.

My approach of understanding where Thanksgiving came from and if it’s appropriate to celebrate based on that is not very chickenlike of me. However, it turns out, it’s not very human of me either. I believe more humans need to exercise their big old brains, even though it’s work, to critically think about what we do, and change if appropriate. We could very easily have a Thanksgiving-like holiday that’s not based on a false narrative about the Pilgrims and Indians — but that seems unlikely. Chickens don’t observe holidays (to my knowledge, at least), but if they did, they’d celebrate Thanksgiving. It’s fun, easy food, gives them a chance to act like chickens, and they won’t think much about it beyond that.

Either way, turkeys are glad I don’t celebrate Thanksgiving — and it’s sad no time has been dedicate in this post to some other real victims. The other reason Thanksgiving is bad is because we factory-farm birds in horrific, abusive conditions so we can have our traditions. #surpriseanimalrights
