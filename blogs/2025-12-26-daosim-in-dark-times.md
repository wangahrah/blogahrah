I don’t spend any time questioning my mental health. I know it’s been shot to shit. Beyond shit. It’s nice to not have worry about if I’m ok or not.

I’d want to see a therapist, but I know they’re doing pretty badly too, and I don’t want to put this on anyone else.

I can’t write. It feels like I haven’t written in so long. I have so many things to say. I just can’t get them out.

There’s been depression. Suicidal thoughts. Teetering on the edge of financial ruin. Long, painful times away from my family. Abusive jobs. COVID-19. Zoom Fatigue. Rock Bottom (at least — it seemed like rock bottom at the time). Devastating fights. Horrific wildfires springing up, burning down local houses. A wildfire, ten miles from my house. Packing bags into a car while ash falls from the sky. Evacuating horses. Two weeks of toxic, smoke filled air.

The birth of my son. Landing a dream job, when I was at my career’s lowest point — then another one — then going back to the OTHER one. Huge strides with my startup. Finding my stride in my marriage. Watching my beautiful kids grow up — and able to spend more time with them than I’d ever hoped for.

The highs have been extremely high. The lows have been extremely low. It’s all been been happing very quickly.
