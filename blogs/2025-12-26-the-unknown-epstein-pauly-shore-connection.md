For legal reasons, I am making no claims nor implying any relationship between Pauly Shore and Jeffrey Epstein, nor do I believe anyone should ever say anything bad about Pauly Shore, and instead, I nominate him for sainthood.

I decided to dig into the Epstein emails, because I think that’s my civic duty as an American citizen.

The first thing I knew I need to search for.

**biosphere**

and boom, there it was. Five instances of Biosphere found. I’m putting together the puzzle pieces. If I disappear, you keep pulling this thread.

In the grand scheme of this fascinating global corruption scheme with tentacles digging in across the globe, I think what I’m about to share with you has almost no impact. (Alternatively, it may end up being the biggest news of the century.)

So buckle up.

Pauly Shore in Biodome. Love it. That’s as far as we need to go with Pauly Shore. Great movie — two thumbs, five stars, no tomatoes.

Browsing Netflix one day, likely back in 2020, I stumbled upon the documentary Spaceship Earth — it covers the Biosphere 2 experiment, where eight people really did Biosphere. They started as a sort of silly seeming art cult lucky enough to have a member with really deep pockets, and grew into a serious science experiment.

How the story played out turned out to be a bit like Biosphere. The kind of the story that get a Netflix documentary. I won’t give you any spoilers really, except for a really big one at the end. Out of nowhere, from the behind the curtain, guess who makes a surprise appearance? None other than **Steve Bannon**!

If I’d been drinking tea, I’d have spit it out when he showed up. Wait, what? The dude who basically did a Brexit hostile takeover of the UK comes in as the evil business hostile takeover guy in the Netflix documentary of a real-life Pauly Shore movie? What world are we living in?

That’s mostly it. As I searched Biosphere, there’s a few things that look like spam comments of copies of texts of web pages included in the document.

There’s also this nugget, sent by John Brockman, who I’d never heard of before, who was a literary agent representing the Biosphere Project. He brings up, just as an interesting note, this crazy Biosphere cult he worked with, and mentions Steven Bannon’s involvement. Perhaps they overlapped — they didn’t seem to be involved together at the time.

--Finally, did I ever tell you about the Biosphere crowd? Absolutely nutty cult I represented in the
early 90s. (Although individually the people were sometimes fun). My friend Roy walford, the
doctor

inside the Biosphere, eventually died because of a condition he developed while inside. I kept
sending

writers down there to work with them and they would inevitably sneak away in the dead of night. I
had to

sell their book three times, each time for a fractions of the previous advance which started in 7
figures. Turns out Bannon took over as CEO of the place in 1993 so we may have overlapped.
