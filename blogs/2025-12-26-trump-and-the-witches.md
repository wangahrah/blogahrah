He’d been in their crosshairs for far too long. I wouldn’t have even thought it was a thing unless I’d seen it with my own eyes.

They’re the OG Antifa. No, not soldiers fighting Hitler.

Witches. Just witches. Disorganized, hot mess, witches.

I’m not sure what pushed them over the edge. Sexism? Misogyny? Racism? Hate? The death of Ruth Bader Ginsberg and impending appointment of someone who might set back women’s rights several decades?

Nope. A full moon.

Seriously. It’s tough to get a organic movement of people to pop up as antifa. In fact, it takes fascism to get them to pull together. And anyone still thinking antifa is a real, organized, funded group — it’s not.
