### How can I be both true to myself and live with community?

I am quick to see the flaws in civilization (and increasingly, in myself). I can work to improve myself, but few individuals are in a place where they can create meaningful changes in society. This leaves us with several choices — often the best of which is accepting what we must of society, and continually growing in understanding of how to behave in a way that is best for both us and others. Perhaps you are enlightened — how will you live in a society that is not? I am sure you will find your own answers as to how you will live and how long you will remain

An acceptance of multiple ways of living life is a soothing solution, depending on if you are alone, in society, and which society you are in — even if some of those seem to be in conflict. Life is a multifaceted game — rather, multiple games, being played simultaneously, with rules as flexible as the players involved. Different sets of rules may appear to be in conflict, but another aspect of the game is finding synthesis in the conflicting rules, allowing your patterns to influence the rules, and knowing when to burn the rulebook.

Live with flexible rulesets to life’s games — understand and be comfortable with the multiplicity of [moral](https://medium.com/@pavlovschicken/moral-authority-without-god-24a52806ada1) frameworks that can exist. Have your own understanding of life…one of your own creation — or rather, created from the flow of life — derived from delving into yourself and the universe, extrapolated into an understanding of how you fit into the fractal of life. Meditate on the *way things are*, and you will gain insight into *how you are.*

This will remain at your core, and change only as the universe changes. When you are by yourself, or with those who understand reality in a way compatible with yours, you are free to embrace that flow internally and externally. This is also a healthy time to examine your relationships, communities, and societies, and derive a way of healthfully interacting with them.

When you are not alone, you will find yourself surrounded by those who find some subset of your ideas foreign — at worst, even repulsive. External ideas will move through you — sometimes to create conflict, sometimes to create a convert. Different is too often viewed as danger. You know how to separate different from dangerous. You will also find truths to incorporate into yourself.

To not become overburdened and lose yourself in these beliefs, you also should create a way of dealing with community morals— this is necessary to assist you in your dance with society. You may bend your personal beliefs to better integrate and commune with others, according to how they view life.

Your community framework should be derived from both your personal flow and from an understanding of societal values around you. Taking society at face value and living that way creates suffering as you rapidly discover its inconsistencies with your own way of expressing things. View societal rules as flexible — do your best to cause no harm or suffering to others, but understand the meaning and purpose behind societal rules.

If you are unable to create a healthy synthesis with your personal morality and your community morality, perhaps it is time to find another community. Change is difficult, but ultimately, favor choices that goes with the flow of the way things are.
